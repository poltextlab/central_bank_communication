2005-01-24,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from January. After reviewing macroeconomic data released in recent months the Monetary Council judged that the favourable inflation trend which emerged towards the end of last year outperforming even earlier expectations would be likely to continue over the period ahead. The decline in inflation and nominal wages in H suggests that the risk of inflation expectations remaining persistent at a high level has diminished. Improvement in the outlook for inflation has made a case for a reduction in the Banks key policy rate. However Hungarys equilibrium position and the markets attitude to it require maintaining a cautious approach to interest rate policy. Although the investment climate worldwide continues to be favourable domestic financial markets have recently showed signs of uncertainty to which the Monetary Council will continue to pay close attention in taking its decisions. The decline in the rate of consumer price inflation continued in December. That also affected core inflation being crucial in the assessment of longerterm trends. A number of factors which monetary policy controls have contributed to the latest interest rate reduction. This is evidence that last years predictable interest rate policy and the stable exchange rate have proved successful in reining in price rises caused by the increases in indirect taxes. In the Monetary Councils view there is a possibility that inflation will return to its level in the period before the tax hikes and therefore the Council does not perceive any considerable risk of inflation rising above the and inflation targets set for end ands end respectively. Last year the primary focus of the Banks interest rate policy was to prevent the indirect increases in taxes from causing a lasting rise in inflation. Wage growth in H was slowing steadily. But Novembers data on private sector wage growth warrants caution. The recent modest increase in wages suggests that the rise in inflation expectations has not been sustained. Consequently disinflation is expected to continue this year. According to the latest data the economic upturn has continued. In particular export and output figures have reinforced the view that corporate business activity picked up towards end. Although household demand rose more slowly in than in previous years its growth rate exceeded earlier expectations. The favourable foreign trade data have slightly reduced the risks to external equilibrium however the current account deficit is estimated to have amounted to nearly per cent as a proportion of GDP. Reducing Hungarys external imbalance requires lowering the general government deficit substantially. Transitory measures played a major part in the deficit outcome. At this juncture therefore there are few signs of a fiscal consolidation programme which would be consistent with the convergence programme and would satisfy financial markets rating agencies and Hungarys European partners. The global investment climate continues to be favourable although it also carries significant risks. However due to the domestic equilibrium problems foreign demand for forintdenominated investments has recently been modest despite international investors continued robust willingness to take risks. Taking into account the above factors with the current basis point reduction in the base rate the interest rate spread has come near to a level which will require the Council to take a cautious policy approach in the future given the risks outlined above. The Minutes of the Councils meeting will be published on February. Inflation in December at was higher than the MNBs inflation target which it had set at .± in October consistent with the Governments MediumTerm Economic Policy Programme. This difference was due mainly to the increase in indirect taxes announced by the Government in mid and implemented in early. Excluding the effect of indirect tax hikes inflation would have remained in the target range. Following the announcement of tax increases the Monetary Council reassessed the inflation target and decided not to counterbalance the direct inflationary impact of the tax measures. The Councils objective with the decision was to prevent higher inflation from feeding through to inflation expectations and to ensure that the increase in prices remain temporary which it stressed regularly in its communications. Although greater certainty will be provided on the issue in the course of the year inflation and wage developments as well as surveys of inflation expectations suggest that last years excess inflation has not led to persistently high inflation expectations. At its meeting the Council also discussed the conceptual framework for the Quarterly Report on Inflation to be issued on February.,1,2005
2005-02-21,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from February. The Council is releasing a separate press statement on its decision. The minutes of the Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March. At its meeting the Council also discussed the February issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation to be published simultaneously with the press release on todays interest rate decision.,2,2005
2005-03-29,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from March. The exchange rate has stabilised competition in several segments of the market has intensified wage inflation has slowed down on the costs side and the rate of consumption growth has moderated on the demand side. In the Councils assessment these developments have all been supportive factors for the disinflation path consistent with the announced inflation objectives and consequently they have provided an opportunity to ease monetary conditions. In recent months there has been a significant decline in prices covered by the core measure of inflation and disinflation has been underway in market services since February. These developments may influence considerably the future outlook for inflation. January wage data for the private sector are consistent with the moderation in wage growth which has started in H. But despite this slowdown wage inflation is still seen as excessively high although the upside risks to inflation from the labour market have fallen. The more benign outlook for prospective inflation relative to earlier periods has been conducive to a slowdown in the growth rate of nominal wages. In assessing the future outlook for inflation the risks posed by shortterm oil price moves must also be taken into account in addition to the fundamentally positive domestic environment. Similarly to the euro area the inflationary impact of rising oil prices on the Hungarian economy has in recent months been mitigated by the depreciation of the US dollar. However the upward risk to inflation arising from erratic oil price developments may increase this year. The latest information related to economic growth is broadly in line with the Councils assessment of economic performance in February which contained a slight slowdown in the rate of growth in. In addition to domestic and international confidence indices the January industrial output data suggest a slowdown in economic activity. January retail trade data are also consistent with the slowdown in consumption expected in. Data on exports and imports have not shown signs of a departure from last years robust trends. This is seen as a positive development in terms of growth. GDP growth in Q met earlier expectations however the pattern of this growth showed a greaterthanexpected slowdown in domestic demand. The combination of a change in the structure of income growth and an anticipated slowdown in growth may add to disinflationary effects. Global financial developments have in recent weeks had a strongerthanearlier effect on the Hungarian money and capital markets. In the very favourable international investment climate capital flows into emerging markets were extremely intense up to midMarch which was reflected in the appreciation of the related currencies the decline in yields and the significant rise in share prices. However probably because of higher longterm dollar yields the direction of global capital flows changed. As an effect of this the Hungarian money and capital markets experienced a correction. The recent global capital market developments suggest higher future risks arising from volatile capital movements which may affect the room for monetary policy to manoeuvre. In taking its decision the Monetary Council also took account of the fact that despite the improvement in inflation outturns in recent weeks the longterm risk assessment of the Hungarian economy had not improved materially as reflected in the continued high interest rate differentials implied by longterm yields. Due to the persistence of risks to economic balance the Council considers it extremely important that the recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and the change to the accounting treatment of payments into private pension fund schemes in particular do not lead to more relaxed fiscal policy relative to that in the Convergence Programme. The minutes of the Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April .,3,2005
2005-04-25,Having reviewed the economic and financial developments at its April meeting the Monetary Council lowered the central bank base rate by basis points from. per cent to. per cent with effect from April. Based on the macroeconomic data revealed in the past thirty days in the Monetary Councils opinion the inflation outlook remains favourable. Despite fluctuations in the CPI data and increased risk in the items beyond the control of monetary policy improvements in core inflation developments substantiate the persistence of a lowrate environment. However risks to equilibrium in the economy and the risks ensuing from sudden changes in the favourable global investment environment remain imminent. In the Councils view the current favourable developments in inflation allow a cut in the base rate however with a view to the risks increased precaution must be taken in monetary policy. Core inflation continued to slow in March which suggests persistence in the disinflation seen in the past few months. Slowdown is due to facts like a stable exchange rate sharp market competition and slowing household consumption. Favourable trend inflation developments suggest that the secondary effects of the stable exchange rate revealed through inflationary expectations are beginning to unfold. This is also shown in a slowdown in wage inflation and the inflation of market services in Q. Due however to the accelerating rise in the prices of items beyond the control of monetary policy primarily motor fuel and unprocessed food prices the overall CPI has also accelerated and the risks towards higher inflation increased. Despite this fact the Council is of the opinion that the conditions of maintaining a lowinflation environment in the long term have improved. The precondition to maintaining an environment of low inflation and stable economic factors in the long term is the management of the equilibrium problems. In the external borrowing requirement of the economy amounted to. per cent of GDP. Although in comparison to the low the rate of nondebt financing has increased the pace of external indebtedness cannot be maintained in the long term. As adaptability in the private sector is limited fiscal policy has a key role in the improvement of the external equilibrium position as it can permanently reduce the borrowing requirement of the general government. Due to the fast increase in the external indebtedness changes in the global investment priorities have a fundamental significance in the domestic money market developments. Following the midMarch decline in the global risk appetite uncertainties pertaining to future prospects have augmented. Although the international investment environment can still be considered as favourable the likelihood of further deterioration has increased and this is a potential risk to the Hungarian economy. A short version of the minutes of the meeting will be published at hours on May. The Monetary Council discussed the MNB publication Report on Financial Stability. The Council will publish a separate statement in connection with the publication of the Report.,4,2005
2005-05-23,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from May. The Council decided to lower the central bank base rate by basis points after taking account of the improved prospects for future inflation and an increase in indirect risks to the central path. The minutes of the Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June. At its meeting the Council also discussed the May issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. Simultaneously with publication of the Report the Council is releasing its own press statement.,5,2005
2005-06-20,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from June. In the Monetary Councils judgement inflation outlook remains favourable in the Hungarian economy and under a forwardlooking approach a low inflationary environment is expected to persist and inflation targets are expected to be achieved. A slowdown in inflation is also facilitated by labour market adjustment and more subdued growth in consumption. In the first few months of the year inflation was consistently below. Data for inflation in May confirm that the inflation of goods that can be influenced by monetary policy has become stable at a low level. The prices of tradable goods sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the forint have been declining for months. The persistence of disinflation is substantiated by the fact that the end trend of decrease in the inflation of market services has not reversed suggesting slower growth in consumer demand. The first months of the year saw the continuation of wage adjustment in the private sector to a lower inflationary environment. The Monetary Council perceives wage adjustment as a sign of the fact that the results of disinflation are here to stay and that they have been incorporated in expectations. Although in the short run the prices of goods especially those of unprocessed food which monetary policy can influence only to a lesser degree pose a higher inflation risk than expected earlier this leaves the mediumterm trend in consumer prices unaffected and thus as regards the to month time horizon the most important one from a monetary policy perspective it does not render the attainment of the inflation target set for end difficult. Detailed GDP data for Q also confirm that the slowdown in inflation over the past year was attributable predominantly to slower expansion in household consumption which remained below GDP growth in both and Q. Households tailor their consumption expenditure to a path that is considerably lower than earlier and is consistent with a slowdown in income growth their rising indebtedness and higher uncertainty surrounding their prospects. Global financial developments are likely to remain important factors in shaping the exchange rate of the forint and yields. Global willingness to take risks and associated demand for forintdenominated assets have been rather volatile over the past few months. In a longerterm comparison however they continue to provide a benign environment. Possible gloomier investor sentiment may indirectly also carry inflation risks. Economic policy commitment to mitigate domestic equilibrium risks and especially the fulfilment of what is laid down in the Convergence Programme may play a key role in reducing such risks. In the Monetary Councils judgement favourable inflation developments allow for the possibility that the base rate can be lowered by basis points. The abridged minutes of the meeting are scheduled to be published at hrs on July .,6,2005
2005-07-18,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from July. Reflecting longerterm inflation trends core inflation has decreased over the past period. It stood at in Q and at in June. Low core inflation is attributable in a large part to a fall in the prices of tradable goods. Decrease has also been discernible in the prices of nondurable goods in the past months. The inflation of market services remains moderate. Moderate expansion in consumption as well as wage and staffing level adjustment in the labour market contribute to a stable low inflationary environment which in turn points to stable inflation expectations. Rise in consumer prices has however exceeded core inflation significantly. It amounted to in both Q and June. Increase in the consumer price index was mainly ascribable to goods exogenous to core inflation. Over the past months shorterterm inflation outlook has been affected not insignificantly by factors that monetary policy cannot influence e.g. by an increasingly persistent rise in oil and unprocessed food prices in particular. In the Monetary Councils judgement risks to longrun equilibrium in the Hungarian economy remain considerable. A precondition for reduction in such risks is a fiscal policy that guarantees that the envisaged tax cuts entailing significant loss in revenues are fully in keeping with the expenditure side and that fiscal consolidation to which commitment was made in the Convergence Programme is implemented. In the international financial markets especially in the CEE region willingness to take risks remains marked which currently offsets the impact of domestic fundamentals on risk perception. As a combined effect of these factors domestic exchange rate developments have been relatively stable over the past period with yields falling. The Monetary Council wishes to reiterate that monetary policy will continue to respond only to persistent trends i.e. ones that influence inflation over the medium term. Accordingly it does not intend to offset transient oneoff impacts arising from tax policy measures by monetary policy ones. The abridged minutes of the meeting are scheduled to be published at hrs on August .,7,2005
2005-08-22,Having reviewed the latest economic and financial developments the Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate by percentage points from. per cent to. per cent with effect from August. The abridged minutes of the meeting are scheduled to be published at. hours on September. The Monetary Council also discussed the August issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation of the MNB. Simultaneously with the publication of the Report the Council is releasing its own press statement.,8,2005
2005-09-19,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from September. Consumer price inflation has been fluctuating between this year. Core inflation better reflecting underlying inflation developments and the longerterm outlook for inflation has stabilised below in recent months. A higher rate of increase in consumer prices relative to core inflation has mainly been accounted for by rises in the prices of oil and unprocessed foods. In the Councils evaluation this years low outturns for the core measure of inflation have also been explained by oneoff factors such as intensifying import competition due to Hungarys EU accession and the transformation process underway in retail trade. These shocks are unlikely to lead to a lasting reduction in inflation however higher demand and the rise in the minimum wage in are expected to increase inflationary pressure. The longerterm macroeconomic outlook continues to be surrounded by uncertainty. Although the current account deficit has fallen slightly relative to the previous year the Council does not consider the buildup in the countrys external indebtedness to be sustainable. A precondition for reducing risks to economic balance is a fiscal stance which ensures that the general government borrowing requirement falls in after taking account of the expected tax revenue shortfalls already officially announced. This factor alone implies a significant degree of fiscal adjustment which rules out any further tax cuts over the short term. The international investment climate has been benign demand for higherrisk financial assets continues to be robust. This has been a contributing factor to the Council gradually reducing the central bank base rate in line with the improving prospects for inflation. However a potential fall in global investor appetite for risk may bring the fundamental risks facing the Hungarian economy to the fore. The minutes of this Council meeting will be published at p.m. on October. At its meeting the Council also discussed the first draft of the Report on Financial Stability to be issued on October .,9,2005
2005-10-24,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council considered the latest monetary and economic developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils assessment a number of factors have facilitated the development of a lowinflation environment over the recent period. Consumer prices were higher in September than a year earlier and the rate of core inflation fell below. However the Council expects a variety of factors to influence future inflation developments. Although the reduction in VAT rates will slow the annual rate of price inflation considerably in its direct effects are likely to wear off in. Different shocks are expected to affect labour costs in the near future which is likely to add to inflation uncertainty. Oil prices have remained high in recent weeks coupled with the buildup of inflationary pressure in the world economy. Nevertheless there appears to be a good chance that the inflation target will be met. The uncertainty surrounding Hungarian economic balance and the countrys convergence process has increased significantly recently. The Council has received several pieces of news which suggest the development of adverse conditions. The Government has revised upwards the deficit ratio for relevant for the adoption of the euro in Hungary. Although this upward revision itself is not expected to affect the countrys indebtedness it may have a negative influence on the markets assessment of Hungarys convergence process. It has become obvious to market participants that over the coming years the budget deficits may turn out worse than earlier expectations. The deficit target for set in the budget bill is higher than outlined in the convergence programme and moreover it involves a number of upward risks as pointed out in the latest analysis by the European Commission. The Hungarian economy has moved farther from the nominal convergence path facilitating the adoption of the euro in. The Council has stressed on previous occasions that the adoption of the euro should be given priority in the interests of longterm economic growth which in turn requires a commitment to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria at the earliest possible date. Although the Government has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to adopting the euro in the announcement has not yet been coupled with specific measures. As regards the external environment there are signs that the current favourable assessment of emerging economies may deteriorate. In the Councils view continued inflationary pressures in the world market could influence major central banks interest policy over the near term. Rises in yields in developed markets may have a negative impact on demand for emergingcountry assets which in turn may lead to an increase in yields on forintdenominated assets. The Minutes of the Councils meeting will be published at p.m. on November. At its meeting the Council also discussed the conceptual framework for the Quarterly Report on Inflation to be issued on November .,10,2005

The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December. The Council also set the dates for its meetings in every second scheduled meeting is interest ratesetting meeting. The dates of electronic publication of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation in are as follows p.m. Monday February short version p.m. Monday May p.m. Monday August short version and p.m. Monday November.

2005-12-19,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Councils overall assessment of domestic economic performance has little changed since its previous ratesetting meeting. Based on the most recent economic data members continue to expect low inflation and favourable business conditions over the medium term. The recommendations for a moderate pay increase in agreed at the trilateral wage negotiations are consistent with the benign inflation outlook. Despite the slight rise in November consumer price inflation and core inflation both continue to be low. It is difficult to measure the extent to which the reduction in VAT rates in will reduce the consumer price index if only in the short term however the Council expects core inflation and the consumer price index to be close to the mediumterm target in. Uncertainty surrounding Hungarys economic balance and convergence has not fallen in recent weeks. The Council has on occasions called attention to the risks stemming from fiscal performance such risks were also reflected in the downgrading of Hungarys domestic and foreign currency debt by Fitch Ratings in early December. Asset prices continue to reflect uncertainty about the convergence process forint yields contain a high risk premium. However unfavourable domestic news affecting the financial markets has been partly offset by the very favourable international investment climate. Despite the interest rate increases by leading central banks in recent weeks longterm euro and dollar yields continue to be low with global demand for highrisk emergingcountry assets remaining strong. On balance current monetary conditions are judged to be consistent with inflation remaining on track to be around the target. Over the period ahead the Council will continue to pay special attention to risks to economic balance and will take the necessary actions if such risks threaten to push inflation away from the inflation target. The minutes of todays meeting will be published at pm on January .,12,2005
2006-01-23,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. Macroeconomic data released since its previous interest ratesetting meeting have not changed the Councils overall assessment of domestic economic performance. Consumer price inflation in December was broadly in line with expectations. In the medium term the Council expects domestic economic growth to be balanced and inflation to be consistent with the mediumterm target. The yearonyear rate of inflation at in December was below the target remaining within the ± tolerance band and core inflation fell to a historical low. The Councils expectation is that core inflation will rise to levels around in the medium term. The reduction in VAT rates in January has made it more difficult to evaluate inflation developments and is also likely to introduce a degree of uncertainty to distinguishing between persistent and temporary effects in the months ahead. Short and longterm yields both fell in the early weeks of simultaneously with the increase in investors risk appetite around the world. However significant risks continue to surround Hungarys economic balance and convergence process. In the Monetary Councils view official interest rates are currently at adequate levels to meet the mediumterm inflation objective. The Council continues to stress the importance of reducing the general government borrowing requirement in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and keep inflation on track around the target. Delays in fiscal consolidation will increase the vulnerability of the Hungarian economy and reduce the room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The minutes of todays meeting will be published at pm on February. The Councils evaluation of meeting the inflation target The yearonyear rate of inflation at in December was below the target and remained within the ± tolerance band. This meant that the Banks inflation target for was met despite the rise in energy prices. In annual average consumer price inflation was and annual average core inflation was. Disinflation affected a wide range of products. Annual average core inflation the best gauge of longterm inflation developments fell to towards end. Rapid disinflation of prices showing fairly stable movements is a sign of price stability becoming broad based. The fall in inflation was particularly marked in the case of goods competing with imports which may have been explained by a combination of global regional as well as domestic developments. Tradables prices also fell to historical lows in developed countries implying that imported inflation remained slow. Disinflation of tradables prices was also explained by changed trade patterns in the aftermath of Hungarys EU accession and by the resulting increase in competition in the domestic market. Finally following the financial market turbulence characterising the second half of the exchange rate appreciated and then stabilised which also supported the disinflation process. In early inflation developments showed clear signs of returning to a more stable path and the oneoff price increasing effect of the tax measures did not build in expectations. Domestic demand did not trigger significant inflationary pressure. Household consumption growth was moderate throughout the whole year remaining significantly below the rates of earlier years and contributed to the pattern of economic growth becoming more favourable. Simultaneously with improvements in the investment climate and the outlook for inflation the Council continued the series of small interest rate reductions begun in spring with further pronounced cuts. As a result of the Councils interest rate policy the base rate fell to by yearend while the forint exchange rate remained in a territory which contributed to inflation returning to levels consistent with price stability. Despite the significant fall in shortterm yields however the continued high level of longterm yields continues to reflect the risks to the longterm economic path. Labour market developments also supported the fall in inflation. The pickup in business activity was fuelled by higher corporate productivity and consequently it did not increase the demand for labour. Rising labour supply also reduced wage inflation pressure. Private sector wage inflation was downwards from H and the rise in corporate sector ULC slowed to levels consistent with price stability.,13,2006
2006-02-27,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Councils overall assessment of domestic economic performance has not changed significantly since its previous ratesetting meeting. Based on the most recent economic data members continue to expect low inflation and favourable business conditions over the medium term. While CPI inflation projected for end is consistent with the Banks mediumterm inflation target of there has been a rise in both the downside and upside risks to inflation in comparison with Novembers projection. In January consumer prices rose by a record low rate in the past several decades due mainly to the reduction in VAT rates. The drop in tradable prices was lower than expected which may be explained by the fact that the cut in VAT is reflected slowly or only partially in consumer goods prices. At the same time the reduction in the inflation of market services prices was higher than expected suggesting that economic agents may have adjusted their inflation expectations to the lower inflation environment. Labour market developments were significantly more balanced in than in previous years. As inflation expectations were being adjusted to price stability wage inflation continued to decline over the year while the slight increase in labour demand observed side by side with an increase in labour supply exerted no perceptible upward pressure on wages. The Council does not expect the labour market to exert inflationary pressure in the medium term but will monitor closely any upward risks arising from the rise in minimum wages in. Despite the favourable inflation and business outlook the uncertainty surrounding Hungarys equilibrium path continues to be a cause for concern. Although for the time being exceptionally good global risk appetite offsets the significant domestic macroeconomic risks the room for manoeuvre of monetary policy may be restricted in the longer term by an increased risk premium required by international investors on forintdenominated assets. The Monetary Council is of the view that fiscal consolidation is currently of key importance for the Hungarian economy. To achieve fiscal discipline it is necessary to implement credible adjustment measures. The Council discussed the revisions made in February to the projection published in the November issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. As announced earlier the Bank will replace its February and August issues of the Report with a shorter version presenting the main changes in comparison with the inflation outlook published in the previous Reports. The minutes of the meeting will be published at pm on March .,14,2006
2006-03-20,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. Macroeconomic data released in recent weeks have reinforced the Councils overall assessment of domestic economic performance economic prospects continue to be favourable both abroad and at home. Although the tax cuts early in have resulted in a smallerthanexpected fall in prices and therefore annual consumer price inflation may turn out higher in than expected earlier recent data on wages and consumer prices as well as disinflation of market services prices which started in the early months of the year have not overall changed the favourable mediumterm outlook for inflation. There was a marked change in international capital markets in March relative to earlier periods. Signs of tighter monetary conditions became prevalent in developed countries which also weighed on emerging markets through the decline in investors willingness to take risks around the world. In the past the Monetary Council has on occasions drawn attention to the risks arising from a turnaround in the extremely favourable environment in international capital markets. Such risks becoming increasingly discernible underline the need to reduce the government budget deficit. It is by correcting economic imbalance that the effects of the unfavourable international processes can be mitigated. The Monetary Council considers meeting the mediumterm inflation target as its most important duty. Were the changes in the international capital market environment or domestic balance to have a lasting effect on the underlying factors of the outlook for inflation the Council will take them into account in taking its decisions. The minutes of todays meeting will be published at pm on April .,15,2006
2006-04-24,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils evaluation there were contrasting developments in the key factors affecting the outlook for inflation in the first quarter of relative to earlier months. The fall in inflation expectations and the sharp decline in market services price inflation have recently influenced inflation prospects favourably. However the weakerthanearlier exchange rate and a rise in imported inflation may have offsetting effects. The forints weakness in early March if the exchange rate remains at its lower level over a sustained period may put upward pressure on inflation on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. Risks of higher inflation have recently been exacerbated by the latest surge in the world market price of oil. On the other hand the March inflation figures appear to reinforce the favourable effect on the longerterm outlook of the decline in market services price inflation which has been underway since early. With regard to the durability of this trend the Monetary Council attaches particular importance to labour market participants also adjusting to the low inflation outlook. Overall in the Monetary Councils judgement the balance of risks to inflation has recently moved to the upside relative to earlier periods however changing the interest rate level is currently not justified due to offsetting macroeconomic effects. The Monetary Council will continue to monitor closely developments affecting inflation and stand ready to take actions as necessary to maintain price stability. In the aftermath of the General Election the Monetary Council once again makes a point of emphasising that the high level of budget deficit continues to be the ultimate source of risks to Hungarian economic balance. For this reason the new government coming to office will have to show commitment to a budgetary adjustment and consequently to take specific actions as soon as possible. The new government will only be able to make the largest contributions to longterm stable economic growth if it ensures a sustainable fiscal position by implementing a credible convergence programme The minutes of todays meeting will be published at pm on May .,16,2006
2006-05-22,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Council discussed the May issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. In relation to the Report the Council is releasing its own press statement. The minutes of todays meeting will be published at pm on June .,17,2006
2006-06-19,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to increase the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from June. In the Councils evaluation the future outlook for the economy and inflation has changed significantly since publication of the May issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. The latest official inflation data and the package of fiscal measures announced by the Government point to marked upward risks to inflation. In addition investor demand for forintdenominated assets has continued to fall recently as a consequence of steadily rising yields in major international capital markets and the continued uncertainty about the assessment of risks associated with Hungarian economic performance. In May the consumer price index rose to year on year coupled with an increase in trend inflation an important guide to assessing the countrys underlying macroeconomic position. And although firm conclusions cannot be drawn based on any one months figure the fact that all of its major components are pointing upwards suggests that the pattern of inflation has been unfavourable in recent months. The package of austerity measures announced by the Government on June is expected to have a significant positive effect on the budget balance and consequently on external equilibrium. As the Hungarian economy has been vulnerable to its twin deficits in recent years the reduction in external and domestic imbalance may contribute to an improvement in the countrys risk assessment and an increase in the room for monetary policy manoeuvre over the longer term. However in the Monetary Councils judgement the composition of the Governments budgetary adjustment programme is unfavourable in several respects. First the planned deficit reduction is based mainly on tax increases which cannot be viewed as a sustainable and therefore credible solution over the longer term taking into account the high taxes on income and fiscal burdens on employment. An improvement in economic balance could only be sustained if it was accompanied by structural reforms and measures to cut expenditure. Second the Council expects the most important measures of the adjustment programme to boost prices significantly. Due to their direct and secondround effects on inflation strong increases in certain administered prices and several other measures of the programme may create an environment which is difficult for monetary policy to assess precisely. In the Banks expectation inflation will rise significantly in in the wake of the adjustment package and will exceed the Banks inflation target by a large margin. All this poses upside risks to wage inflation and carries the danger that inflation will rise above the target in due to the spillover effects. A moderate wages policy by the Government may mitigate these influences. The recent rise in yields in major international markets has added to the vulnerability of the Hungarian economy. The announcement of government measures has not yet been sufficient to alleviate investors concerns. In its conduct of monetary policy the Council will take special care that the prevailing yield spread reflects the required risk premium on forintdenominated assets and thus ensures a certain degree of protection in an international environment for investments which has become less benign recently. Weighing these considerations the Council took a decision to increase the central bank base rate. The minutes of this Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July .,18,2006
2006-07-24,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to increase the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from July. In the Councils judgement meeting the mediumterm inflation target set jointly with the Government requires a tighter policy stance than currently. The Councils objective is therefore to create firmer monetary conditions by raising the Banks key policy rate in a series of steps. Trend inflation better capturing the less volatile components of inflation developments and virtually all the important components of core inflation have risen in recent months. This points to a sustained rise in inflation. The Council expects inflation to rise significantly throughout. Inflation may turn out to be above the target in the year relevant for monetary policy if monetary conditions are to remain unchanged. In addition to trend inflation developments several measures contained in the Governments budgetary adjustment programme are likely to provide a oneoff boost to prices and the forint exchange rate which has now been weaker for a longer period also poses upside risks to inflation over the period ahead. By tightening its monetary policy stance the Council intends to prevent the upward effects on domestic prices of the Governments crucially important measures to restore external and domestic equilibrium from feeding through to economic agents expectations and thus from causing sustained inflationary pressures. The Monetary Councils decision to raise the central bank base rate also took into account the fact that in recent months the environment for investments had turned less favourable worldwide and in the region and also that investors believed that the risks associated with investments into Central and Eastern Europe had increased irrespective of Hungarian economic fundamentals.

2006-08-28,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to increase the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from August. Economic data which have become available over the past few weeks and the Governments stabilisation measures announced recently have led the Monetary Council to revise materially its view of macroeconomic conditions. The planned measures are expected to contribute significantly to a substantial reduction in the general government deficit and Hungarys external financing requirement which in turn may improve the countrys risk assessment. However meeting the mediumterm price stability objective requires further monetary tightening due to the increased upward risks to inflation. The direct effects of the budgetary measures and increases in indirect taxes and administered prices are expected the have the strongest upward effect on consumer prices over the short term. Measures causing increased costs of production which may force the corporate sector to raise prices at some point in the future contribute to this. However the Governments actions affecting incomes are expected to act as a drag on domestic demand growth which may partly offset direct inflationary consequences. The latest consumer price data particularly those for processed foods and market services point to higher inflation over the period ahead. In addition to the expected effects of the planned fiscal measures imported inflation and particularly rises in the world market price of oil poses an upward risk to CPI inflation. All of these influences are expected to lead to a temporary pickup in inflation then inflation may fall gradually towards the end of after reaching a peak in the first half of. But even after the expected immediate effects of the fiscal measures unwind inflation is likely to be above the target if the current monetary conditions are to remain unchanged over the entire forecast period. In particular during the period most relevant for monetary policy i.e. quarters from now headline and core consumer price inflation both would be significantly higher than the Banks mediumterm target. Inflation expectations and future labour market conditions may play a key role in the mediumterm effects and potential spillover of the oneoff price increases expected to occur in the near future. Dwindling demand and rises in the costs of labour may depress firms demand for labour which coupled with layoffs in the public sector may result in higher labour supply. Nevertheless private sector nominal wages may only continue rising if market participants do not factor the expected oneoff price increases into their expectations. For this reason it is a key task for the Monetary Council to coordinate inflation expectations and to mitigate the secondround effects of the planned fiscal measures by pursuing predictable monetary policy. The minutes of this Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .,20,2006
2006-09-25,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to increase the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from September. In the current environment of rising inflation it is important for the Monetary Council to stress that meeting the mediumterm inflation target is its primary objective over the horizon relevant for policy. A crucial condition for this is to improve the general government balance and Hungarys external equilibrium. Economic data which have become available over the past few weeks reinforce the Councils view in August that there might be a significant probability of inflation rising above the target in the absence of further monetary policy tightening. The most recent data are evidence of increased inflationary pressure. The rise in inflation during the summer months appears to have been very broadly based and cannot be linked to oneoff shocks. The weaker forint exchange rate the sudden rise in unprocessed food prices early in the year and the increase in inflation expectations may have contributed to a pickup in inflation of industrial goods processed foods and market services respectively. Looking ahead the recent fall in the world market price of crude oil if it continues may have a positive effect. The decline in oil prices may not only put downward pressure on inflation directly through lower fuel prices but it may also reduce the rate of further rises in administered energy prices. In taking its decision the Monetary Council also took into account the recent increase in the risk premium required for holding Hungarian assets. The minutes of this Council meeting will be published at p.m. on October .,21,2006
2006-10-24,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to increase the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from October. In the Councils view there are a number of uncertainties surrounding the assessment of recent inflation developments. The latest macroeconomic data confirmed the picture of rising inflationary pressures since early summer. Although oneoff factors such as the increases in administered prices and VAT rates may have played a role in the rise in price levels in September the underlying trend of inflation is likely to be upwards over the period ahead. Unfavourably the fast pickup in inflation in recent months has affected a broad range of products which may be seen as a sign of increased inflation expectations. Private sector wage data for recent months are also a warning signal. However interpretation of earnings figures is made more difficult by the combined impact of increased tax burdens and changes in the regulatory environment. Bonus payments in August unusually high by the standards of the previous years also appear to reflect these effects. Nevertheless the rate of wage inflation is likely to have accelerated recently even taking into account the temporary influences. The fall in crude oil prices and the strengthening of the exchange rate in recent weeks are good news for inflation prospects. To the extent that these developments persist they will have a positive influence on the outlook for future inflation. Financial markets have stabilised somewhat in recent weeks as reflected in foreign investors largescale purchases of forints. In the Councils view the main reasons for this seem to have been the improvement in the international environment for investments and the MNBs interest rate increases over the recent period in addition to foreign investors belief that the implementation risk of the Governments stabilisation package has diminished. In the Councils assessment the risk of a sustained rise in economic agents inflation expectations remains high. The Council has therefore judged it necessary to tighten monetary policy. In order to maintain price stability it is crucially important that oneoff measures boosting the general price level should not be built into economic agents inflation expectations and particularly into nominal wage growth and so they should not generate sustained inflationary pressure in the economy.

2006-11-20,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Council discussed the November issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. In relation to the Report the Council is releasing its own press statement. The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,23,2006
2006-12-18,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. Prices have increased sharply across a broad range of products over recent months. According to the latest data the rate of consumer price inflation slowed in November though it still remained high. Inflation is likely to pick up again strongly in the beginning of partly due to the base effect associated with the VAT cut in early and partly to further increases in administered prices and it is expected to fall materially only in the second half of. Further out the risk of feedthrough from oneoff price rises remains because of the persistently high rates of price increases. There has been robust growth in industrial output and net exports recently benefiting from the recovery in the world economy. By contrast domestic absorption has changed little over the past two months. Despite the benign international context the rate of Hungarian economic growth is likely to slow significantly next year due to the moderation in domestic demand which in turn may contribute to offsetting inflationary pressures. Investors mood has improved around the world which has also been reflected in the fall in forint yields and the appreciation of the exchange rate. The credibility of the Governments intentions to consolidate the fiscal position has increased influencing money and capital market developments over the recent past. In the Monetary Councils judgement the risks to future inflation are significant and likely to remain in the period ahead. In view of the uncertainties the Council will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully and will aim to prevent potential secondround effects from taking hold. The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on January .,24,2006
2007-01-22,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. Economic data released since the latest policy meeting have not altered the Monetary Councils view of the Hungarian economy materially. According to the underlying measures of inflation the general picture is one of a significantly higher inflation environment than the level implied by price stability. In contrast with individual factors driving price developments for example consumption demand the exchange rate and oil prices which point to a slowdown in inflation the rate of wage growth continues to be higher than expected. The latest wage data indicate that the growth of wages in the private sector has been high recently. This strong growth has emerged against the background of a loosening of labour market conditions. However it is too early to tell whether this process reflects a deterioration in inflation expectations or an adjustment to changes in the regulatory environment. Recent output data have reinforced earlier signs of a widening in the gap between external and domestic demand growth. The rise in the volume of output in November suggests that industrial activity remains buoyant. In the Councils judgement the risks to future inflation are significant and highly likely to persist in the months ahead. In view of the uncertainties the Council will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully and will aim to prevent potential upward effects of oneoff measures on the general price level through higher expectations from triggering a spillover into higher inflation. The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February. The Councils evaluation of the achievement of the inflation target The annual rate of inflation in December at was higher than the target set for end and was also outside the ± tolerance band. In the inflation target could not be met in large part because of factors outside the influence of monetary policy. The average rate of consumer price inflation in was and that of core inflation was. As a positive effect of factors determining inflation the rate of price increases had come close to the level implying price stability by end and early with the risks to economic balance remaining particularly pronounced. The favourable underlying developments in and the benign outlook for inflation coupled with the necessity of fiscal adjustment characterised the picture of the Hungarian economy up to mid. A slowdown in tradables inflation was the major driving force behind good inflation performance which was explained by the combination of a disinflation of tradable prices globally Hungary joining the European Union and the transformation of trade patterns in the wake of the accession. In addition reaching a level close to price stability was also supported by the stable and strong exchange rate as well as by wage inflation which was becoming increasingly in tune with price stability. Inflation reached a turning point in mid with inflationary pressures rising across a broad range of products. The Monetary Council expected the effects of intensifying competition in earlier years to unwind and core inflation to pick up. In mid however there were signs suggesting that inflation would rise at a faster rate than expected earlier due to the sharp increase in unprocessed food prices the pickup in wage inflation and the weakening exchange rate. From September as a consequence of the measures taken by the Government administered prices rose strongly and the increase in indirect taxes affected a wide range of product prices. These measures contributed significantly to inflation in December exceeding the target by percentage points. Beyond the direct inflationary effects the measures may cause changes in pricing behaviour and wage agreements. The Monetary Council therefore clearly reaffirms its commitment to meet the mediumterm inflation target and it will continue to aim to anchor inflation expectations and stabilise inflation around .,25,2007
2007-02-26,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the February update of the Quarterly Report on Inflation the central projection conditional on staffs assumptions is for inflation to fall significantly from H following the high outturns for CPI in the next few months. In the Monetary Councils judgement inflation may slow significantly within the period relevant for monetary policy i.e. in as a result of very subdued domestic demand and loose labour market conditions. The Banks tight policy stance in recent months has also contributed to the current favourable outlook for inflation which in turn is needed to be sustained to meet the mediumterm target. However the central projection is surrounded by considerable uncertainties. For the Council the most important upward risk to inflation is potential rises in price and wage expectations. In this regard the continued rise in private sector wage growth towards the end of is a cause for concern. However the interpretation of information on wage developments may be made more difficult by two factors i wage data may be biased downwards temporarily following the tightening of labour market regulations and ii the timing of irregular payments in the private sector may also have changed due to rises in tax and contribution rates. In addition special attention must be given to wage developments in the government sector. Another source of uncertainty is the impact on inflation of the slowdown in domestic demand which may point to lower inflation over the period ahead. Taking into account the extent of the decline in demand expected for there is considerable uncertainty about the scale of the slowdown and its effect on inflation. Overall the Councils central view is that there remain significant risks to the outlook for inflation. Future developments in inflation expectations are perhaps the most important source of uncertainty. Consistent with its commitment to price stability the Monetary Council will continue to pay particular attention to inflationary risks and future developments in wages are of particular importance for the Council in this respect. The Council will aim to ensure that the expected higher rates of inflation in the coming months prove only temporary and that they do not feed into inflation expectations. The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .,26,2007
2007-03-26,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Monetary Councils judgement information received in the past month provides evidence that the Hungarian economy continues to grow along the central path assumed in the February issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation and consequently inflation may ease back close to the mediumterm target in H. However the latest data do not appear to have reduced the risks to the central projection. There was a fall in the market component of the consumer price index and particularly in the monthonmonth rate of core inflation which may imply that considerable price pressures have not yet emerged in the Hungarian economy over and above the oneoff upward impact on prices of the Governments measures. One source of uncertainty is that although the January growth rate of regular pay in the private sector may pose an upside risk to the outlook for inflation the detailed GDP data reflect a gradual easing in domestic demand. Pay growth in some sectors of the economy is inconsistent with the slowdown in productivity growth and the expected decline in demand. It is still difficult to make an accurate measure of wage inflation and its likely impact as adjustment to the changes in labour market and tax regulations may bias statistical data upwards. According to the latest data the fall in certain components of domestic demand within the overall pattern of growth was even more marked than in the past. On the demand side this may have a dampening effect on inflation and reduce potential upward pressure caused by higher wage inflation. However it may lead to a fall in firms profitability which in turn may add to the risk of a pronounced decline in economic growth and employment. The fall in the risk premium on forintdenominated government bonds over the recent period may also suggest an improvement in investors sentiment about the longterm sustainability of the fiscal adjustment measures. This may provide increased room for manoeuvre in interest rate policy in the future. Taking all these factors into account the Monetary Council decided to leave the Banks key interest rate unchanged. The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April .,27,2007
2007-04-23,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The reasons of the decision are as follows According to the assessment of the Monetary Council the information received during the past month yields a miscellaneous picture as far as the trends of the Hungarian economy are concerned. While the data for the first two months of confirmed previous inflationary expectations the latest March data have been more ambiguous. During the first quarter the core inflation component of the consumer price index decreased which is an auspicious sign as far as the disinflation process is concerned. In March however prices of nondurable consumer goods and processed food products increased at a rate higher than expected. More information is required in order to determine whether that increase has been a momentary or a lasting phenomenon. While compared to February the increase of wage payments in the competitive sector has slowed down slightly the rate has remained relatively high. It is still difficult to assess the rate of the inflation of wages and its consequences with the required precision since it can be significantly affected by the adaptation to the changes of regulations on the labour market and in taxation and by the rise of inflationary expections. The interest spread of HUFdenominated government bonds has continued to decrease a trend that started at the beginning of the year. Apart from the more favourable assessment of the austerity measures of the government this may have been due to the fact that in April investors have been willing to assume higher risks than during the earlier period. The interest rate may be reduced at a later date if the adjudgement of the level of risk by the investor community continues improve and the inflationary trends so permit. The minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May .,28,2007
2007-05-21,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. Also at its meeting the Council discussed the May issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils judgement from its current high level inflation is likely to return to close to the mediumterm target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy although this process may be slightly slower than projected in the previous Report. However this path seen as the most likely outcome continues to be surrounded by risks in both directions. In the current high inflation environment expectations remaining stuck at a level incompatible with price stability continues to represent the most important upside risk to inflation. In this regard it is good news that recent developments in consumer prices have been consistent with the fall in inflation expected by the Council. However the rapid rise in wage growth is still a cause for concern despite the reduced scope of the informal sector. Nevertheless falling demand in response to the fiscal austerity measures may result in a greaterthanexpected disinflationary impact. Business conditions continue to be shaped by the benign external environment and weak domestic demand. In the pace of Hungarian economic growth is likely to slow due mainly to fiscal consolidation and the decline in household consumption. But growth may recover over the next few years as the effects of fiscal restriction unwind gradually and domestic demand may contribute significantly to growth. The government deficit may remain below the target this year and next explained mainly by the strongerthanexpected increase in revenue. However this favourable picture becomes rather mixed as the expected decline in revenue as a percentage of GDP over the longer term poses risks to meeting the deficit targets for subsequent years. Consequently meeting the expenditure targets for may require additional government measures which could provide a solid foundation for the objectives set out in the Convergence Programme. Risks to the Hungarian economy have diminished significantly recently. Fiscal adjustment has made a material contribution to the reduction in the countrys external financing requirement this year. And the international investment climate has been broadly supportive in recent months. The Monetary council decided to leave the policy rate on hold taking into view the high degree of uncertainty around the future outlook for inflation. Even if investors positive sentiment about forintdenominated investments remains a necessary condition for reducing the policy rate further is a greater degree of certainty with which upside risks to inflation are eliminated. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June .,29,2007
2007-06-25,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points to. In the Councils judgement data for the past month provide evidence that inflation has passed its peak. The seasonally adjusted monthonmonth rate of core inflation which is a good guide to underlying inflation has fallen to a level consistent with price stability. Against this background the risk of inflation remaining stuck at elevated levels appears to have eased. Domestic demand has been rising at a moderate pace broadly in line with the Councils expectations. According to wage data for April the rate of nominal wage growth in the private sector continues to rise however the changes to labour market and taxation rules distort the official numbers. After eliminating this effect using the approach outlined in the latest issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation the rate of wage growth has not picked up further recently. In addition the seasonally adjusted monthonmonth rate of wage growth based on regular pay in the private sector also slowed. Statistical data derived from the latest labour market survey show that the services sector adjusted to past wage increases by reducing employment. Looking forward this implies that unit labour costs will probably rise at a lower rate than assumed earlier which in turn may also mitigate inflation risks. All this is reinforced by developments in the price index for services so far this year. The reduction in uncertainty around the outlook for inflation has made it possible for the Bank to reduce the policy rate in line with the markets favourable sentiment about forintdenominated assets. However uncertainty around future inflation developments continues to warrant a cautious policy stance. Even with the market maintaining its overall positive sentiment about forintdenominated assets further reductions in the Banks policy rate will only be possible if upside risks to inflation continue to diminish. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July .,30,2007
2007-07-23,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at. In the Councils judgement inflation developments over the past few months have been broadly in line with the projection in the May issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation and the mediumterm target for inflation. After eliminating the effects of tax changes core inflation the best measure of underlying inflation developments slowed significantly in the second quarter although the June outturn showed some increase. In the Councils view the risk that inflation expectations could depart sharply from the inflation target has recently eased considerably. The latest data point to a continued slowdown in economic activity. Private sector gross nominal wage growth continues to be stronger than productivity gains even after eliminating the distortions caused by recent changes in the regulatory environment. But uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation of labour market data. There is no single indicator of wage developments which could form the basis for a wellinformed assessment of inflationary pressure arising on the cost side. The Council believes there is room for further reductions in the central bank base rate in the future. However there remains considerable uncertainty around economic developments at home and internationally which requires a cautious and gradualist strategy of interest rate cuts. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August .,31,2007
2007-08-27,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at. The Council also discussed the August issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Monetary Council continues to believe that the mediumterm target for inflation will be met in. The rate of consumer price increases is likely to moderate more slowly in than expected earlier due mainly to temporary factors outside the influence of monetary policy. In the August Report projection inflation falls to below in mainly reflecting transient effects. There has recently been a marked though temporary deterioration in the domestic economys growth prospects and the level of output may lag behind the longerterm trend over the forecast period. In the Councils judgement the supply shock affecting output growth in agriculture will prove shortlived. However the cyclical indicators suggest that the greaterthanexpected decline in demand may also have played a role in the recorded slowdown in GDP growth in Q. This larger fall in demand may pull down on inflation over the longer term. But in the short term consumer price developments are affected negatively by the supply shocks to the economy. Rises in agricultural prices and the price of oil are likely to put upward pressure on inflation in however the expected reversal of rises in food prices may contribute to inflation falling below target in. Consistent with its earlier practice the Monetary Council does not wish to respond to largely temporary price fluctuations triggered by shortlived supply shocks. The inflationary effects of cost and supply shocks of the past year may only unwind simultaneously with a rapid adjustment of wage growth. There are signs that the rate of wage growth may have started to moderate in H. The Monetary Council continues to monitor closely indirect inflationary effects induced by expectations and wage developments. In the Councils view the greaterthanexpected slowdown in economic growth and the strong disinflationary effect of the fall in demand continue to represent downside risks. The financial market turbulence stemming from the problems in the US subprime mortgage market has contributed significantly to uncertainty in the global investment environment leading to a rise in the required risk premium on forint assets. However the Council believes that the imbalances in the domestic economy have recently diminished considerably. This in turn has reduced Hungarys vulnerability to external shocks. In line with the prospects for inflation and the economy the Monetary Council continues to believe there is room for further reductions in the central bank base rate in the future. However a great degree of caution is needed in making monetary policy decisions given the considerable uncertainty in the international environment. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .,32,2007
2007-09-24,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to. The news since the previous policy meeting has not materially changed the macroeconomic outlook. The Council therefore expects the level of output to remain below potential and inflation to fall gradually over the next two years. If the recent sharp increases in prices of agricultural output foods and energy do not pass through to other prices the inflation target can be met in. From the perspective of secondround inflationary effects expectations of economic agents influencing price and wage developments have an important role. The significant slowing in domestic demand growth as evidenced by Q GDP data and the decline in household consumption expenditure may have a disciplinary effect on firms wage and pricesetting behaviour. However the Monetary Council will continue to closely monitor indicators which may point to the emergence of sustained inflationary pressure. In this respect next years wage agreements may be indicative. Although the international financial environment continues to be surrounded by uncertainty there has recently been a marked improvement in market sentiment towards domestic investments. In the light of these considerations the Monetary Council assumes there is room for further reductions in the policy rate. However upside risks to inflation coupled with continued uncertainty about the global investment environment warrants a cautious approach to adjusting interest rates. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on October .,33,2007
2007-10-29,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at. In the light of fresh economic data released since the previous policy meeting the Monetary Council continues to assume that the Banks mediumterm inflation target will be met in in which the rate of growth remaining weak by the standard of recent years will play a role. However a necessary condition for meeting the inflation target is that oneoff price increases should not lead to a sustained rise in expectations. Based on the latest information available the Bank expects food prices to rise significantly over the short term. Food price inflation can be related in part to worsethanusual weather conditions however the sustained increase in international demand may also play a part and therefore it may also affect the mediumterm prospects for inflation. But other core inflation components do not point to further inflationary pressure. Private sector wage inflation eased back in August mainly explained by employers in bringing forward bonus payments in anticipation of changes in regulations. Consequently annual wage growth is expected to be very volatile over the remainder of the year. After adjusting for these factors the outlook is for wage growth to ease gradually. Further moderation in nominal wage growth is a prerequisite for sustained low inflation. Wage increases consistent with productivity gains reduce the risks that a series of shocks to inflation from agriculture energy prices and other demand factors could lead to a higher rate of price increases over a protracted period and inflation expectations could become stuck at high levels. Recent financial market developments suggest that the international turbulence stemming from problems in the US mortgage market has so far had a temporary effect on market sentiment towards forintdenominated investments. The current macroeconomic and financial environment may leave scope for the Council to reduce the base rate however considering the upside risks to inflation and uncertainty surrounding the global investment climate the Monetary Council will continue to exercise care in setting interest rates. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on November .,34,2007
2007-11-26,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at. The Council also discussed the November issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Monetary Councils view is that inflation will decline gradually and economic growth rise slowly over the next two years consistent with the projection presented in the Report. The recent rise in food prices has put strongerthanexpected upward pressure on overall inflation and therefore annual average inflation in is likely to be around despite the contractionary effect on domestic demand of the Governments fiscal adjustment measures. For the Council the most likely scenario continues to be a decline in inflation to in as an effect of subdued domestic demand growth. However this requires that the fast increase in prices over the past few years in response to a series of external shocks should not lead to expectations becoming stuck at high levels. There has been more evidence since the August projection that food price inflation triggered in part by external causes may persist for a while. The latter combined with the sharp rises in energy prices and other adverse shocks over the recent past creates an environment for monetary policy in which the emphasis is placed on counteracting secondround inflationary pressure and bringing down inflation expectations. The slowdown in domestic demand may help to rein in secondround inflationary pressure because firms will face increased difficulty in offsetting the earlier downward squeeze on profit margins by raising prices. As a consequence the disciplinary strength of lacklustre demand may contribute to disinflation through restraining pay growth or as a less benign outcome through a fall in employment. Nevertheless the Monetary Council continues to closely monitor price and wage setting trends in the private sector. It is of key importance for the Banks objective of delivering price stability that next years wage increases should be consistent with both productivity growth and the prospective fall in inflation. There continues to be considerable uncertainty in international financial markets caused by the problems in the US mortgage market. Investors risk appetite has fallen again recently which in turn has had a negative effect on required risk premia on forintdenominated assets. The Councils decision to leave the key policy rate unchanged also reflects its judgement about the uncertainty surrounding the international environment and domestic inflation developments. There will be a case for a further reduction in interest rates if domestic economic conditions suggest that the risk of higher inflation transmitted through expectations has diminished and international financial market sentiment has improved further. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,35,2007
2007-12-17,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at. Economic data released since the November meeting have not materially changed the Councils view of economic prospects. The Governments fiscal consolidation measures as well as the cost shocks of the recent past are likely to lead to significantly higher inflation and economic growth below potential in. The Council expects inflationary pressures to diminish in response to the slowdown in economic growth and consequently inflation may fall back to close to the target by after the primary effects of the cost shocks unwind. However a potential increase in inflation expectations continues to represent an upside risk. Based on the detailed GDP figures for Q the slowdown in the real economy is likely to have reached its low point however at present there seems to be little probability of a rapid recovery. And despite strong export growth the components of domestic demand show few signs of picking up. Consumer price inflation rose in November. That partly reflected the recent rapid rises in food and energy prices. For inflation to ease back to the level compatible with price stability it is crucial that higher food and energy prices do not lead to a sustained increase in expectations. Price and wage decisions consistent with weak demand growth would contribute to faster economic growth. There continues to be considerable uncertainty in international financial markets caused by the problems in the US mortgage market. In the circumstances demand for emerging market financial assets and forintdenominated assets in particular is driven mainly by investors willingness to take risks rather than by countries economic fundamentals. High volatility and general uncertainty are expected to remain in international money and capital markets over the next few months. The Monetary Council left interest rates unchanged after taking account of the risks surrounding inflation expectations and international capital markets. The Council will have scope for reducing interest rates further if domestic economic conditions suggest a reduction in the risk of higher inflation transmitted through expectations and an improvement in international investor sentiment towards the Hungarian economy. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on January .,36,2007
2008-01-21,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Council maintains its view that as a consequence of the fiscal measures and the cost shocks of the recent past inflation may be above target and economic growth below potential in. With the unwinding of the firstround effects of these shocks the inflation rate may slow to close to the target in however a potential rise in inflation expectations continues to represent an upside risk. Consumption demand continued to be weak according to recent retail sales data. Industrial production appears to have slowed with the slowdown in the rate of export growth being a contributory factor in addition to the weakening in domestic demand. Downside risks to growth may increase due to uncertainties about the outlook for global economic activity. CPI and core inflation both rose relative to November. This increase largely reflected rises in food and vehicle fuel prices continuing the trends seen earlier in the year. However inflation of other product prices over which monetary policy has most control has not accelerated. Two factors are of key importance for the future prospects for inflation i the way in which oneoff shocks will influence economic agents price and wage setting decisions and ii the extent to which policy will be able prevent a rise in inflation expectations. Inflationary developments in the world economy coupled with further increases in administered prices in Hungary constitute further risks to inflation. Private sector wage growth slowed somewhat in November mainly on account of lowerthanusual bonus payments. The recommendation of the Interest Reconciliation Council foreshadows a further moderation in wage growth. In contrast the increase in the minimum wage for skilled workers represents an upside risk. Price and wage decisions consistent with subdued domestic demand would contribute to a fall in inflation and indirectly they would provide a boost to growth. There remains considerable uncertainty in international financial markets. The repricing of credit risk is likely to continue in the coming months. International investors willingness to take risk in emerging markets has moderated recently. The Monetary Councils decision to leave the policy rate unchanged reflects its assessment of the risks associated with inflation expectations and international capital markets. The future path of interest rates depends on the degree to which expectations will feed through to inflation and on the direction future developments in international money and capital markets will take. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February. The Monetary Councils assessment of inflation performance in Consumer price inflation remained above the mediumterm target throughout and even exceeded the ± tolerance band. Annual average inflation was. Monetary policy actions affect inflation only with a lag. Generally the strongest effect is felt after about quarters. Consequently inflation developments were influenced mainly by the decisions the Council took in the period between H and. The period end H was characterised by a benign inflation environment which however was achieved in combination with unsustainable fiscal policy over the long term. Although the Monetary Council emphasised the need for fiscal adjustment on several occasions the structure of such an adjustment programme remained unknown for most of the period. International experience has shown that there are significant differences in fiscal adjustments in respect of the degree to which monetary policy should react to such measures. For this reason monetary policy adopted a waitandsee approach. Factors such as increases in VAT and certain administered prices as well as reductions in price subsidies played an important role in the fiscal adjustment programme launched in the summer of. These in turn led to a sharp rise in inflation in. The Bank decided not to neutralise the oneoff direct upward effects on prices of the measures as it would have led to excessive growth sacrifice. The Council therefore chose to allow inflation to rise temporarily above the target in. However it could not disregard the fact that the price increases might cause a sustained rise in expectations which threatened to lead to an indirect persistent rise in inflation. Partly to prevent such a situation and partly because of the rise in risk premia the Monetary Council raised the base rate in small steps by a total of two percentage points. Other unforeseen shocks also contributed to inflation rising above target in addition to the fiscal measures. An example is the increase in food prices explained among other things by adverse weather conditions in and a rapid expansion in the global demand for food. Rises in international energy prices also had inflationary effects particularly as they also fed through to administered prices. Without the increases in administered prices as well as in energy and food prices above expectations inflation would have exceeded the target by a much smaller margin. Although in the Bank decided not to offset the upward effect on prices of the oneoff and unforeseen shocks it subsequently pursued a course of policy which aimed to ensure that inflation expectations did not reflect the price rises over the medium term. For this reason in the central bank base rate consistently exceeded earlier market expectations. In the future monetary policy will monitor carefully changes in inflation expectations and will make every effort to deliver price stability in the medium term. By achieving and maintaining price stability the Bank can best contribute to longterm economic growth and a predictable macroeconomic environment.,37,2008
2008-02-25,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March. At its meeting the Monetary Council also discussed the February issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils view while Hungarian economic growth continues to be weak the fall in inflation may be slower than previously expected consistent with the projection presented in the Report. Although the inflationary effects of the fiscal adjustment measures implemented since have been wearing off the disinflation process has more recently been held back by cost shocks of both international and domestic origins. The sharp rises in food and energy prices as well as the increases in domestic producers energy prices and administered prices at rates above inflation have been particularly relevant in this respect. The Council has on several occasions expressed that it does not intend to offset the direct effects of cost shocks due to their temporary nature. However were potential secondround effects to arise which could lead to a sustained rise in inflation expectations monetary policy tightening could not be avoided. The recent rise in producer prices has forced domestic firms to make marked adjustments in order to ensure that operations remain profitable. That in turn is acting as a brake on economic growth over the short term. For the time being only a smaller part of the adjustment has occurred through prices and the Council expects it to be fully implemented basically through restraining labour costs and improving productivity. This view is reinforced by the subdued rise in wage costs in the final quarter of. However the prospects for economic activity have deteriorated in recent months. The contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to be lower in due to the slowdown in the global economy. Moderate real wage growth and the fall in employment are likely to hold back household consumption growth. Deteriorating external domestic economic activity as well as rises in credit spreads are expected to be constraining investment. Evidence from business and household surveys suggesting that economic agents expect the economic recovery to be increasingly sluggish over the period ahead is consistent with this view. These factors may contribute to a fall in inflation from the demand side. The deterioration in the international investment climate has had an adverse impact on the premium required on forintdenominated assets. If the recent rise in exchange rate risk perceived by investors persists it may put additional upward pressure on inflation. In the Councils judgement the adjustment which has been underway in the private sector is a positive development however the new cost shocks are putting its sustainability at risk. A prolonged period of disinflation carries the risk that expectations may become stuck at a relatively high level. If the emergence of secondround inflationary effects cannot be ruled out with certainty in the near term then monetary policy may have to be tightened.,38,2008
2008-03-31,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from April. The Council maintains its view that Hungarian economic growth is likely to be below potential and inflation to fall only slowly this year and in. Upward pressures on inflation of the fiscal adjustment measures are wearing off however the further reduction in inflation has more recently been held back by domestic and international cost shocks. The Council has on several occasions expressed that it does not intend to offset the temporary effects of cost pressures rather it monitors closely any potential secondround effects that may occur. Although inflation shocks have so far been concentrated on the prices of a specific range of products new pressures particularly those from rises in producers energy prices and wage costs may have more persistent and broader inflationary effects. According to January wage data the introduction of the guaranteed minimum wage and the increase in the national minimum wage both led to a strongerthanexpected rise in private sector average earnings. This has added to costpush inflationary pressure despite an easing in labour market conditions on the back of the fall in employment. The slow disinflation process has amplified the secondround effects on prices of the cost shocks the reason being that as a result expectations may become stuck at a high level. Hungarian government securities yields have increased markedly across the maturity spectrum in the past month. Closely related to the financial shock emanating from the US mortgage market the repricing of risks has continued leading to sharp rises in yields on more risky financial assets. Although nonfundamental factors may have also played a role in the rise in domestic government securities yields there is clear evidence of a increase in the risk premium on forint assets recently. In the Councils judgement the risk of inflation remaining persistently above per cent and the rise in the risk premium on forint assets have both pointed to the need to raise the central bank base rate. And the Council will stand ready to take further actions in order to met the inflation target. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April .,39,2008
2008-04-28,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from April. The Council maintains its view that the Hungarian economy is characterised by subdued growth and a slow decline in inflation and the further fall in inflation has been impeded by cost shocks of both domestic and international origin. The Monetary Councils aim is to contain any secondround effects potentially arising from persistently high inflation and to prevent an increase in longerterm inflation expectations. Based on information which has become available recently there continue to be risks to meeting the inflation target next year. Oneoff effects make it difficult to evaluate the latest wage data however taking these into account the risk that the rate of wage growth will fall more slowly than expected earlier is significant which in turn may add to costpush inflationary pressure. For the time being inflation data suggest little evidence that the negative output gap has had disinflationary effects on a wide range of goods and services prices. In the Councils judgement inflation risks have made it necessary to raise the central bank base rate. The Monetary Council will continue to stand ready to take the necessary actions in order to meet the Banks inflation target. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May .,40,2008
2008-05-26,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from May. The Council discussed the May issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils view consistent with the projection presented in the Report Hungarian economic growth continues to be subdued and the fall in inflation has been less rapid than expected. The Council decided to raise official interest rates at its meetings in March and April in response to the deterioration in the outlook for inflation. Inflation has been falling less fast than expected due to cost shocks of domestic and international origin inflation may be significantly above target in assuming unchanged monetary conditions however it may reach the target in if the significant upside risks do not materialise. The output gap is likely to remain negative over the entire forecast period due in part to the dampening effects on demand of fiscal policy which will help to reduce inflation through its disciplinary effect on domestic firms price and wage setting decisions. Improvements in external and domestic balance is expected to reduce the vulnerability of the economy. However there are significant upside risks on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. Despite the pressing need to adjust the reduction in the rate of wage growth may be slower than expected as a consequence of the recent cost shocks. If economic agents pass more of the cost increases through to higher prices or if they rely more heavily on past inflation in their price and wagesetting decisions than assumed in the central projection it will add to inflation pressures. And if the recent deterioration in the global inflation environment continued it would also increase the risk of higher domestic inflation. In the Councils judgement the policy tightening that has taken place so far will contribute to the further reduction in inflation despite the strong cost shocks affecting the economy. The Council remains committed to achieving the per cent target while striving to prevent secondround effects. It has taken its decision to raise the base rate in view of the significant risk that the inflation target would not be met on the horizon relevant for policy. The Monetary Council believes that maintaining tight monetary policy is necessary and it will stand ready to take actions if there is a threat to the inflation target. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June .,41,2008
2008-06-23,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Council maintains its view that Hungarian economic growth continues to be subdued and inflation has been falling slowly over recently. The negative output gap may help to reduce inflation on the horizon relevant for monetary policy while inflation expectations potentially becoming stuck at a high level as well as the global rises in food commodity and energy prices are contributing to upside risks to inflation. Faced with the deteriorating outlook for inflation the Monetary Council decided to tighten policy at its previous three policy meetings. The latest information has confirmed that there continue to be risks to meeting the inflation target. But also taking into account the tightening in monetary conditions the latest data have not altered the central inflation projection in the May issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. Based on recent private sector wage developments it is too early to draw a firm conclusion about the disciplinary effect of the fall in demand. The Council remains clearly committed to achieving the per cent inflation target. It is making efforts to prevent a rise in longerterm inflation expectations and believes that tight monetary policy should be maintained to reach this goal. However the Council will stand ready to tighten policy further if meeting the target warrants it. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on July .,42,2008
2008-07-21,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Council maintains its view that Hungarian economic growth has remained subdued and inflation has been falling at a slow rate over recently. The negative output gap may help to reduce inflation on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. In contrast inflation expectations potentially becoming stuck at a high level as well as the global rises in food commodity and energy prices are adding to the upside risks to inflation. Data received over the past two months reveal that inflationary pressures have increased due to rising oil prices and diminished due to the strengthening of the forint exchange rate. The Monetary Council does not seek to prevent the adjustment of the relative prices of energy consistent with shifts in global supply and demand however it seeks to prevent this process from resulting in persistent inflationary pressures. The latest inflation and wage data are consistent with the central path in the May issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Council remains committed to achieving the per cent inflation target. Tight monetary conditions help to bring down inflation gradually and to reduce indirect potential inflationary pressures from expectations. The Monetary Council will stand ready to take the necessary steps if meeting the inflation target warrants it. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on August .,43,2008
2008-08-25,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Council discussed the August issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils view consistent with the projection presented in the Report Hungarian economic growth will continue to be subdued and inflation will fall slowly over the period to. In the current projection inflation exceeds the per cent target in before easing back to it in as an effect of domestic and foreign cost shocks. The level of output is likely to remain below its potential on the horizon relevant for monetary policy which in turn will help to bring inflation down. Global factors contributed significantly to inflation exceeding the mediumterm target throughout the second quarter of. The tightening monetary conditions partly offset the effects of a higher international inflation environment however on balance prices of imported goods in domestic currency terms continued to rise. There has been unfavourable news for global economic activity in recent months. The fasterthanexpected slowdown in global activity may contribute to a fall in international commodity and energy prices and ultimately to disinflation in Hungary. Aiming to prevent inflation expectations from becoming stuck at a high level continues to be the Monetary Councils most important task. The underlying reason for this is that if economic agents in their wage and pricing decisions relied more heavily on past inflation than the assumption in the current projection disinflation would be slower and entail higher real economic costs. Taking all these into account the Monetary Council decided to leave the Banks key interest rate unchanged. Maintaining tight monetary conditions is justified as long as there are no clear indications both internationally and domestically of a sustained decline in upside risks to inflation. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on September .,44,2008
2008-09-29,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank left the central bank base rate unchanged.,45,2008
2008-10-20,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement the prospects for the Hungarian economy are shaped primarily by global factors. In recent weeks the effects of the global financial crisis have become increasingly evident in the domestic financial markets. The global liquidity shortage has led to disturbances in markets. In the situation maintaining the smooth functioning of financial intermediation is of key importance for the Monetary Council. To achieve this goal the Magyar Nemzeti Bank has taken or initiated several important policy actions in recent weeks. Reviewing the latest economic developments the Council has concluded that inflation may fall further continuing the trends of the past few weeks. However the slowdown in global business activity has led a to a deterioration in the outlook for growth in Hungary. The expected international economic developments increase the probability of a sustained fall in oil food and other commodity prices. In addition the slowing in Hungarian growth stemming from the economic downturn in Europe and the curtailment of lending by domestic banks is also likely to help reduce inflation further in Hungary. In the Councils judgement therefore maintaining tight monetary conditions is necessary in the current market environment. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on November .,46,2008
2008-11-24,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and reduced the central bank base rate by basis points from to effective from November. The Council discussed the November issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. The crisis hitting the international financial system has caused a fundamental change in the path of the Hungarian economy in recent months. In the period ahead economic growth and inflation both may be sharply lower than expected earlier. With a temporary decline in economic activity followed by a slow recovery inflation may fall significantly below the per cent target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. The fall in investors willingness to take risk internationally and the sharp reduction in market liquidity make it necessary to reduce further Hungarys external financing requirement which may be achieved through a closing of the gap between incomes and expenditures of domestic economic agents. As a consequence of the financial crisis growth in Hungarys foreign trade partners has slowed significantly and therefore the correction of external and domestic demand is taking place simultaneously making it particularly difficult to adjust. The deterioration in the prospects for economic activity at home and abroad has led to a considerable shift in the future path of inflation compared with earlier expectations. In addition to a weakening in domestic demand the reduction in inflationary pressures from the global economy closely linked to oil commodity and food prices are expected to contribute to inflation easing back at a faster pace. A month ago amidst a general decline in willingness to take risk the narrowing in liquidity worldwide and a lack of confidence in the countrys ability to finance its external debt the exchange rate of the forint came under significant downward pressure much greater than justified by economic fundaments. In these extraordinary circumstances the Monetary Council decided to increase the base rate by basis points on October in order to preserve the stability of the domestic financial intermediary system check capital outflows prevent depreciation expectations from increasing further as well as to make it more expensive to speculate against the forint. The agreement reached with the International Monetary Fund and the governments planned budgetary adjustment measures reduced the risks of financing the countrys external debt which in turn increased the room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The Monetary Council therefore decided to reduce the base rate. Official interest rates can be reduced further if the risks around the persistence of capital inflows and the stability of the financial intermediary system continue to diminish. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,47,2008
2008-12-08,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments. Deviating from its normal decisionmaking schedule the Council reduced the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from December. The decision to reduce the base rate has been justified by the significant change in circumstances leading to the basis points increase at the Councils special meeting on October. Last week European central banks decided to reduce key policy rates as risks to both real economic performance and inflation were clearly on the downside. There has recently been an improvement in sentiment towards the Hungarian economy and uncertainty related to external financing have diminished significantly due to the international loan package the announced budgetary adjustment measures and the adoption of the law introducing a ceiling on fiscal expenditure. In the Monetary Councils view the reduction in the central bank base rate has been facilitated by the current international environment and justified by the domestic economic outlook. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,48,2008
2009-01-19,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and reduced the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from January. Over the period ahead the Council expects inflation to be below the mediumterm target and the economy to suffer a sharp downturn. Data released over the past month indicate that the outlook for the real economy has deteriorated further. Domestic industrial production fell more sharply than expected and indicators of global economic activity foreshadow a weaker outlook for external demand. As an effect of these factors it seems likely that inflation will be lower than previously expected. Monetary policy should continue to take particular attention to preserving the stability of the financial intermediary system and to ensuring that capital flows remain balanced in addition to focusing on inflation and real economic performance. Risks associated with external financing have recently declined gradually coupled with an improvement in the ability of the financial intermediary system to absorb stress. However there remains considerable uncertainty with limited room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The Monetary Council took its decision to ease policy further consistent with the projections of an economic downturn and a sharp decline in inflation. The base rate may be reduced further in the coming months if capital flows remain undisturbed and the stability of the financial intermediary system is preserved. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on February. The Councils assessment of inflation performance in Although the consumer price index fell significantly over as a whole it stayed consistently above the Banks per cent mediumterm inflation target and except in the final month of the year it even remained outside the ± per cent tolerance band. The annual average rate of inflation was. per cent however the consumer price index fell to. per cent in December. Inflation moved above the tolerance band in the second half of. The high rates of inflation in the years had in large part been caused by increases in administered prices closely related to the fiscal adjustment measures. By contrast in high inflation was due mainly to cost shocks of global origin which however moderated in the second half of the year. Food and commodity prices rising at extremely rapid rates and with unpredictable magnitude up to mid played an important role in inflation moving above target. Monetary policy may influence inflation only with a lag inflation developments were influenced mainly by the monetary policy actions of. The inflationary effects of rises in food and commodity prices would only have been fully offset by a rapid and drastic tightening of policy. However first there was no scope for such action up to February due to the intervention band and second the Monetary Council saw no reason to do so because of the significant real economic costs involved. The Council tightened policy in an effort to avoid the secondround effects of cost shocks. But the fall in inflation in the period to autumn was slower than the Bank expected even after eliminating the effects of the unforeseen cost shocks. One reason for this was that back in the MNB thought the prospective decline in domestic demand in the wake of fiscal adjustment would lead to a sharp slowing in the rate of inflation. The eventual fall in demand did reduce inflation however the magnitude of the reduction in inflation was smaller than expected. And although the Bank continuously pointed out that the potential rate of growth was slowing the magnitude of this was greater than expected. Consequently the decline in demand over the period to autumn did not lead to a significant increase in spare capacity in the economy and therefore the fall in inflation had a less pronounced effect. Labour market developments also contributed to lowerthanexpected inflation. In its wagesetting decisions the private sector did not adjust fast enough to the weaker prospects for economic activity as suggested by unit labour cost data. The sustained high inflation rates of past years may also have kept economic agents inflation expectations at high levels. In the Monetary Councils view the easing in inflation in autumn will continue and the inflation target may be met in. The Council will be committed to achieving a sustained reduction in inflation. In the future economic agents taking their price and wagesetting decision consistent with the Banks inflation target may contribute to the maintenance of price stability.,49,2009
2009-02-23,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. At its meeting the Council also discussed the February issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. Over recent months global economic conditions and the prospects for growth both have deteriorated more sharply than previously expected. In Q output in the worlds major economies fell and growth in emerging economies slowed significantly. Governments of the worlds major economies announced substantial fiscal actions however so far these have had little practical effect. The sharperthanexpected decline in external demand has led to a significant deterioration in Hungarys growth prospects. The countrys exports are comprised mainly of capital goods and production equipment and demand for these has fallen sharply recently due to the recession in Europe. Based on available information conditions in Hungarys export markets are likely to deteriorate significantly in and consequently a recovery in exports is unlikely before at the earliest. The decline in bank lending activity may continue. On the demand side there has been a fall in debtors willingness to borrow in response to the continued deterioration in the outlook for business activity. On the supply side banks lower appetite to take risk has led to a decline in lending activity. In addition the domestic financial sector has been forced to reduce its dependence on foreign funding which may also lead to a curtailment of lending. The tightening of credit standards has been another factor contributing to a decline in lending. That in turn may result in reduced household consumption as well as in lower corporate investment and production. The measures recently announced by the government are also likely to lead to a weakening in domestic demand. The governments policy package aimed at restoring fiscal balance may contribute to an increase in the economys potential rate of growth however it is only likely to have an effect from. Declining demand suggests that inflation is likely to remain low. As an effect of the government measures inflation may rise above the mediumterm target temporarily however the annual rate of inflation is expected to fall significantly below per cent in the second half of. In the recession the rise in inflation is most likely to have little lasting effect and it is unlikely to put the Banks inflation target at risk in the medium term. The Hungarian economy must adapt to the recent changes in the financial and economic environment. Monetary policy attempts to mitigate the costs of adjustment using the instruments at its disposal. However there has recently been a shift in willingness to take risks and in investors perception of risk associated with the Central and East European region narrowing the room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The Monetary Council took its decision to maintain interest rates after consideration of the projections for the economy and inflation as well as the need to preserve the stability of the financial intermediary system. The Council will continue to take particular attention to preserving the stability of the financial intermediary system and to ensuring that capital flows remain undisturbed. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on March .,50,2009
2009-03-23,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. Over recent months international investors willingness to take risk has declined sharply and sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe has deteriorated leading to a significant depreciation of the forint. Any further weakening in the exchange rate would have a harmful effect on the capital position of the domestic financial intermediary system in the medium term. In addition its expected stimulative effect on output may be questioned. In the Councils judgement the risk of an even deeper economic downturn than previously expected has increased. Manufacturing and market services slowed significantly in the final quarter of due to declining external demand and the contraction of lending. Households are adjusting to the shifts in international financing conditions and the deterioration in the prospects for income growth by curtailing consumption expenditures which in turn is acting to reduce Hungarys external financing requirement. Inflation has fallen to a level consistent with price stability in recent months. However this reflected contrasting developments in the economy. Services price inflation has been falling sharply for several consecutive months owing to the disciplinary effect on pricing of the economic downturn. However the passthrough of weaker exchange rates into tradables prices is adding to upside risks to inflation. In the short term exchange rate depreciation contributes to an improvement in the profitability of exporting firms and the competitiveness of domestic producers against imports however its effect on growth may be offset by the fact that economic agents are suffering sizeable losses on their positions taken in anticipation of an appreciation. The depreciation of the forint has led to a slowing in lending by banks and it may worsen their capital position over the medium term through a deterioration in the loan portfolio. After consideration of the latest developments in the real economy and inflation as well as the need to preserve the stability of the financial intermediary system the Monetary Council decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The Council will continue to focus on preventing a persistent deviation of financial market conditions from economic fundamentals. To this end it is ready to use the full range of monetary policy instruments at its disposal. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on April .,51,2009
2009-04-20,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Council continues to expect that the Hungarian economy will be undergoing a sharp downturn this year. Inflation may be around the target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy due in part to discipline imposed by the economic recession on pricing behaviour. Data released over recently indicate that the outlook for economic activity in Hungary has deteriorated further. The decline in external demand and the contraction of lending led to a marked slowdown in the economy in the final quarter of. The weakness of industrial production and retail sales suggests that the downturn has gathered pace. Households are adjusting to the tightening in global financial conditions and the deteriorating outlook for future incomes by curtailing consumption expenditure which in turn is acting to reduce Hungarys external financing requirement. With the slowdown in the global and domestic economies inflation has fallen substantially. The significant easing in services price inflation this year reflects the effects of declining demand. The weakening of the forint in the first months of the year has not yet fed through fully into tradables inflation. Inflationary pressures associated with exchange rate depreciation may become more pronounced over the period ahead which however may be mitigated by declining demand. In the past month global willingness to take risks has increased and sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe in previous months has not deteriorated further. However global and domestic financial markets continue to be extremely volatile. After considering the outlook for the real economy and inflation as well as the need to preserve the stability of the financial intermediary system the Monetary Council decided to leave the central bank base rate unchanged. The abridged minutes of todays meeting will be published at p.m. on May .,52,2009
2009-05-25,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Council discussed the May issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. The outlook for the world economy have continued to weaken in recent months. The economic downturn in Hungary is likely to be deeper than the European average as the slowdown in activity abroad the tightening of credit supply and the Governments fiscal measures are acting as a drag on growth simultaneously. Domestic inflation may drop below the Banks mediumterm target as a result of the sharp downturn in activity after allowing for the temporary effects of tax changes. Data released over the past quarter indicated a further deterioration in the outlook for the domestic economy. World trade fell by nearly onefifth in the first few months of. Based on the latest data however the slow recovery in business expectations and destocking may suggest that business conditions have been stabilising. The slowdown in Europe has had unusually adverse effects on the external trade sector due to the composition of Hungarian exports. The Governments actions to improve competitiveness coupled with the real depreciation of the forint over the recent period have been only partly successful in offsetting the decline in external demand. The Hungarian economy is only expected to recover in in line with the outlook for growth in Europe. Domestic firms have frozen wages sharply reduced employment and postponed investment decisions in response to their worsening sales prospects. But despite these efforts corporate profitability has deteriorated considerably with the adjustment process likely to continue in the period ahead. Greater income uncertainty caused by falling employment and the contraction of credit supply are prompting households to scale back consumption and investment spending. As a result propensity to save may increase further with a pickup in domestic demand not expected before. The introduction of new policy instruments by the MNB and direct lending by the Government are helping the banking sector cope with reduced access to funding in the market. However lending activity is expected to remain subdued due to uncertainty about the prospects for growth and banks are likely to seek to reduce risks associated with their loan portfolios. Procyclical fiscal policy has also contributed to the decline in domestic demand. Constraints on deficit financing do not permit the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers in full. Over the longer term the actions taken by the Government to maintain fiscal sustainability are expected to contribute to an increase in the economys potential growth rate and to putting the governments indebtedness on a sustainable path. All these factors may help restore market confidence and reduce the costs of financing for the economy however they may deepen the recession over the short term. There has been a considerable improvement recently in sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe and the domestic financial markets have shown signs of consolidation however global appetite for risk has remained volatile. Although the package of fiscal measures announced by the Government may lead to a further improvement in sentiment towards Hungarian assets over the longer term this has not yet been reflected in higher demand for domestic financial assets. The Monetary Council took its decision to maintain interest rates after considering the outlook for the real economy and inflation as well as the latest financial market developments. The base rate may be reduced further in the coming months if the recent improvement in sentiment continues and if policy easing does not jeopardise the stability of the financial intermediary system and does not threaten to disrupt capital flows.

2009-06-22,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at. The Monetary Council continues to judge that the Hungarian economy is undergoing a severe downturn this year. Inflation is likely to rise sharply over the short term due to the indirect tax increases however it may be close to target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. Data released over the past month show that value added fell across all goods producing sectors in Q. The weakness of industries producing for the domestic market also played a role in the decline in output in addition to the deterioration in the performance of the export sector. Households have cut back their spending recently in response to the further tightening in credit conditions and the adjustment in wages and employment in the labour market which in turn has contributed to a reduction in the countrys external financing requirement. Nevertheless the Hungarian economy continues to face difficult external demand conditions. Although business confidence indices in the countrys export markets show some signs of improvement economic activity in Europe is unlikely to recover rapidly. Given this outlook the Hungarian economy is only expected to recover convincingly in. Over the past two months inflation has remained above the inflation target mainly reflecting oneoff factors and it is expected to increase substantially further from the second half of the year due to the change in indirect taxes. The weaker exchange rate compared with the average of previous years has not yet passed through fully into domestic prices however the decline in demand may mitigate the possible future effects of depreciation. Overall inflation may settle below the target over the horizon relevant for monetary policy due to the prolonged weakness of domestic demand. The increase in investors appetite for risk around the world and the improvement in sentiment towards the economies of Central and Eastern Europe in the spring have been largely sustained over the past month. However Hungarys dependence on foreign funding and the ongoing strains in domestic financial markets call for caution in the conduct of monetary policy. The Monetary Council took its decision to leave interest rates unchanged after considering the outlook for the real economy and inflation as well as the latest financial market developments. The central bank base rate may be reduced if the recent improvement in risk sentiment is sustained. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July in line with the release schedule announced earlier. However the release schedule for the minutes of the Monetary Councils ratesetting meetings will change from August.

2009-07-27,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from July. Consistent with the assessment of previous months the Monetary Council continues to judge that the Hungarian economy is undergoing a severe downturn this year and that a rapid recovery in growth is unlikely over the period ahead. Inflation rose in Q reflecting the combined effect of several factors. First the weaker exchange rate relative to the average of previous years has been feeding through gradually into domestic prices. Second shocks related to certain volatile components of the CPI also drove up overall inflation. By contrast a more prolonged period of subdued demand limits the scope for price increases as evidenced by lower services price inflation compared with the average of previous years. Looking ahead the Monetary Council expects inflation to be below the mediumterm target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy however inflation is likely to be high over the next twelve months as a result of the indirect tax changes which in turn adds to upside risks to inflation through expectations. Real economic adjustment has also been reflected in the substantial improvement in external balance. Current account data for Q showed that the adverse economic environment the deterioration in the outlook for growth and earlier constraints on access to credit put pressure on economic agents to cut back their expenditure sharply. Although this is clearly positive from the perspective of rebalancing the economy it also raises the possibility that domestic demand may be weakening faster than projected and consequently output could decline more sharply than previously expected. Net exports may be stronger than forecast due to a sharperthanexpected decline in imports. Global risk appetite and sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe have stabilised in recent months after improving in the spring. In line with this perceptions of risk associated with the Hungarian economy also improved. As a result favourable trends also emerged in the money and capital markets relevant for Hungary. The first foreign currency sovereign bond issue since the onset of the financial crisis was a success and nonresident investors purchased large amounts of forintdenominated government bonds in the secondary market after a long pause. The exchange rate settled at higher levels than previously accompanied by reduced volatility. In the Councils judgement the recent improvements in perceptions of risk and external balance have allowed and the developments in the real economy and inflation justified a reduction in the central bank base rate. Interest rates may be reduced further consistent with the inflation targeting framework if trend inflation developments do not jeopardise price stability and if perceptions of risk allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August .,55,2009
2009-08-24,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from August. At its meeting the Monetary Council also discussed the August issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils assessment although the global economic environment remains uncertain it has stabilised somewhat over recent months and there has been no further deterioration in economic prospects. However the global and domestic economies are unlikely to recover rapidly in the near term. Hungarian economic growth is expected to resume in. Inflation is likely to rise above the mediumterm target temporarily reflecting the effects of increases in indirect taxes and move substantially below it in the second half of. The decline in domestic demand played a greater role in the contraction of the domestic economy than earlier expected due primarily to sharp reductions in firms stocks and largerthananticipated cutbacks in investment. In addition household consumption continued to decline rapidly. Rising uncertainty about the outlook for employment and incomes coupled with tightening credit conditions prompted households to increase savings. As a result of adjustment in the private sector the external financing requirement declined markedly. In the Councils judgement the series of inflation shocks potentially resulting in an increase in economic agents longerterm inflation expectations poses the greatest risk to the longerterm outlook for inflation. However domestic demand has fallen to an extent that apart from the effects of the tax changes a low inflation environment can be expected even taking into account that risk. After improving significantly in previous months international investor sentiment and assessments of risks associated with the Hungarian economy have not changed materially over the past month. The substantial decline in the external financing requirement and the resumption of government borrowing directly from the bond market also contributed to an easing of concerns about the countrys external financing. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in the economy and inflation and in assessments of risks. Monetary policy may be eased further if it does not pose a threat to the inflation outlook and if assessments of risk allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .,56,2009
2009-09-28,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from September. The Monetary Council expects domestic economic growth to resume in the middle of. Inflation is likely to exceed the mediumterm target temporarily due to the indirect tax increases and then to move materially below it in the second half of next year. The global financial environment has continued to stabilise over the past month however the risks of future shocks should not be ignored. In the Councils judgement the mediumterm outlook for inflation is favourable. The decline in demand has been a major contributing factor which has impeded firms ability to raise prices. The JulyAugust inflation data have also suggested that as a result of weak demand firms were able to pass on the VAT increase to consumers only partially. However one factor continuing to pose a risk to the longerterm outlook for inflation is that the successive upward shocks to inflation could lead to a lasting increase in economic agents inflation expectations. Real economic adjustment to the consequences of the crisis has also been reflected in the sharp improvement in external balance. Disciplined fiscal policy also played a significant role in the improvement in external balance. However there is uncertainty over the longerterm sustainability of certain nonstructural measures included in the fiscal adjustment package which in turn may make it difficult to achieve and maintain longterm macroeconomic balance. Labour market adjustment has been slightly less pronounced than expected wages have grown at high rates in recent months relative to the performance of the economy. Longterm price stability cannot be achieved if productivity growth is persistently exceeded by real wage growth. Next years tax reductions are likely to provide an opportunity for employers and employees to reach an agreement to maintain gross earnings at their current level taking into account the outlook for inflation. Wage moderation may help improve corporate sector profitability and consequently it may contribute to maintaining employment and hence generate a faster economic recovery. Global risk appetite has increased further in recent months as evidenced by declines in government securities yields and interbank lending rates in Hungary. The forint exchange rate fluctuated in a lower range than in previous months and the risk premium on Hungarian sovereign debt returned to levels seen before the failure of Lehman Brothers. However giving reason for caution is that international capital market conditions remain fragile. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in the real economy and inflation and improved perceptions of sovereign risk. Interest rates may be reduced further if this is allowed by the inflation outlook and shifts in risk sentiment. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on October .,57,2009
2009-10-19,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from October. The Monetary Council expects domestic economic growth to resume in the middle of. Inflation is likely to exceed the mediumterm target temporarily due to the indirect tax increases and then to move materially below it in the second half of next year. Consistent with the more benign outlook for the world economy there has been a steady improvement in global financial markets in recent months however it remains to be seen whether and for how long this process will continue. The monthly outcomes for consumer price inflation over the past quarter were below the Banks expectations. The persistence of subdued inflation despite the increase in indirect taxes is attributable mainly to restraint imposed by weak demand on pricing. In the Monetary Councils judgement the risk that inflation will fall significantly below the target over the medium term has increased. Available labour market data suggest that the corporate sector has adjusted to weak domestic and foreign demand by moderating earnings growth and sharply reducing employment. Wage moderation is of key importance for firms seeking to maintain their competitiveness. Setting wages by taking into account the protracted recession and the expected low inflation environment may help keep jobs and contribute to a faster economic recovery. The reliance of the Hungarian economy on external sources of financing can only be reduced if a sustained improvement in external balance is achieved. Maintaining a disciplined fiscal policy approach is required to gradually reduce the countrys vulnerability to shocks. A couple of measures taken by the Government to ensure that this years deficit target is met could prove difficult to sustain in the longer run. This is a risk in terms of meeting the budget target for and poses a threat to the fiscal consolidation process. There has been a steady and substantial increase in global risk appetite in recent months leading to a fall in the risk premium required by investors to hold Hungarian financial assets. However the domestic economy continues to be vulnerable to shocks which suggests the need for heightened caution in policysetting. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in inflation and the macroeconomy as well as in perceptions of risk. Interest rates may be reduced further if this does not threaten the inflation outlook and if shifts in risk sentiment allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on November .,58,2009
2009-11-23,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from November. At its meeting the Monetary Council also discussed the November issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Councils judgement is that Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of as the economy recovers from this years sharp downturn. Inflation is expected to exceed the mediumterm target temporarily due to the indirect tax increases and then to move materially below it in the second half of next year. Conditions in the global financial system have improved gradually over the past few months reflecting the buoyancy of the global economic outlook however some uncertainty about the sustainability of these developments remains. The Hungarian economic scene has been dominated by a sharp contraction in domestic demand and signs of a pickup in economic activity abroad. In response to the deterioration in the labour market outlook and declining lending activity households have scaled back consumption spending and companies have postponed investment plans and run down their stocks. The fasterthanexpected recovery in external demand has only been sufficient to slow the pace of decline in GDP. The fall in domestic demand largely due to the above adjustment process and the pickup in economic activity abroad have resulted in a considerable reduction in the country external financing requirement. The outcomes for consumer price inflation over the past few months were below expectations. Continued subdued inflation despite the indirect tax increases is attributable mainly to the restraining effect of weak demand. In the Monetary Councils view inflation may fall substantially below the target over the medium term. Recent labour market trends suggest that companies are adjusting to weak domestic and foreign demand by moderating earnings growth and sharply reducing employment. Setting wages by taking into account the protracted recession and the expected low inflation environment may help keep jobs and contribute to a faster economic recovery. The external vulnerability of the Hungarian economy may only be reduced if a sustained improvement in external balance is achieved. Households increased propensity to save is expected to continue to help restore external balance. Maintaining an extremely disciplined fiscal policy approach is required in order to gradually reduce the countrys vulnerability to shocks and achieve the budgetary targets set by the authorities. Global risk appetite has increased significantly in recent months which has led to a decline in yields required by investors for holding Hungarian financial assets. However there is a risk that the pace of the recent increase in risk appetite has been faster than would be justified by the improvements in global economic fundamentals. The domestic economy continues to be vulnerable to shocks. This together with the above risk requires caution in policysetting. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in the economy and inflation as well as improvements in perceptions of risk. Interest rates may be reduced further if this does not threaten the inflation outlook and if shifts in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,59,2009
2009-12-21,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from December. In the Councils judgement Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of as the economy recovers from this years sharp downturn. Inflation is expected to remain elevated temporarily due to the tax increases and then to move materially below the Banks target in the second half of next year. There has been no further increase in global risk appetite in recent months with a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounding future developments in international financial markets. Rising activity abroad and declining demand at home continue to shape Hungarian economic performance. Prompted by the deteriorating labour market outlook falling real incomes and the contraction of lending households are scaling back consumption spending and companies are postponing investment plans. The output of exporting industries has recently begun to rise owing to a rebound in external demand however this has only been sufficient to slow the pace of decline in GDP. Due to the weakness of domestic demand the Hungarian economy is expected to recover with some lag compared with developed countries and the economies of Central and Eastern Europe. The country external financing requirement has fallen considerably in response to the above adjustment process and the pickup in economic activity abroad. The key factor driving movements in the prices of products affecting significantly the mediumterm outlook for inflation has been the decline in demand. The increase in inflation in November was largely related to rises in the fuel price index a component excluded from core inflation. The Monetary Council retains its view that inflation may fall substantially below the target over the medium term. International investor sentiment and assessments of risks associated with Hungarian financial assets have both been very volatile over the recent period. Investor concerns about the sustainability of government debt in a number of countries have come to the fore. In order to reduce Hungarys high government debt and vulnerability to external shocks it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined longterm sustainable fiscal policy. Changes in perceptions of risks associated with the Hungarian economy have made it possible to significantly reduce the central bank base rate in recent months in line with the outlook for inflation and growth. In the Monetary Councils judgement the uncertainty surrounding future developments in global financial markets has allowed a smaller reduction in interest rates than in the past. In view of the above considerations the Monetary Council decided to reduce the base rate by basis points. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on January .,60,2009
2010-01-25,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from January. In the Monetary Councils judgement Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of as the economy recovers from last years sharp downturn. Inflation is expected to remain elevated temporarily due to the tax increases and then to move materially below the Banks target in the second half of the year. Global appetite for risk has been volatile in recent months and there remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. Domestic economic performance has been driven by a modest pickup in demand abroad and a continuing decline in demand at home which in turn has contributed to a reduction in the current account deficit to close to balance. Hungarian economic recovery is likely to lag behind that of developed countries and the economies of Central and Eastern Europe on account of persistently weak domestic demand. The decline in consumption has been a major factor shaping movements in the prices of products dominating the mediumterm outlook for inflation. Items excluded from core inflation accounted for most of the increase in inflation over the past two months. The Monetary Council continues to expect inflation to fall substantially below the target at a horizon out to years. The deterioration in global financial market sentiment and assessments of risks associated with Hungarian financial assets in December did not continue over the past month. However investors continued to be concerned about the sustainability of government debt in a number of developed countries. In order to reduce Hungarys high government debt and vulnerability to external shocks it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined longterm sustainable fiscal policy. The Monetary Council saw scope for only a cautious reduction in interest rates due to the uncertainty surrounding future developments in world financial markets. The Council therefore has decided to reduce the base rate by basis points. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February. The Monetary Councils assessment of inflation performance in In the Monetary Councils assessment the Banks inflation target was not met in despite the fall in consumer price inflation to close to the target in early. Subsequently however inflation rose slightly above in the second half mainly on account of the effects of the tax changes in the course of the year. Nevertheless the Council judges that inflation developments in brought about a market change compared with the previous period given the break in the inflation inertia of previous years. This is most clearly reflected in the slowdown in services price inflation. After fluctuating around in previous years the services price index eased back to stand close to in after adjusting for the effects of indirect tax increases. Trend inflation developments suggest that recently the inflation target has come within reach. Prior to the indirect tax increases in H the annual price index was practically consistent with the inflation target core inflation excluding volatile items was on average in the period JanuaryJune. Shortrun measures of inflation adjusted for the effects of indirect tax increases were below target throughout the second half of the year. Weak demand driven by the severe economic downturn has put downward pressure on inflation and has reduced the risk that inflation might be stuck temporarily at high levels. The Monetary Council will use its best efforts to help the Hungarian economy to move towards price stability. Achieving and maintaining price stability is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to growth and a predictable economic environment over the long term.,61,2010
2010-02-22,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from February. The Monetary Council discussed the February issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils judgement Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of as the economy recovers from the sharp downturn of. Inflation is expected to remain elevated temporarily due to the increases in taxes and administered prices and then to fall significantly in the second half of the year before dipping below the Banks target in. There remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. Hungarys GDP continued to fall in Q. However the pace of decline moderated considerably mainly reflecting a pickup in exports in the wake of the recovery in external demand. By contrast the contraction in domestic demand is continuing. In consequence the recovery in Hungary is likely to lag behind that of developed economies and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The diverging trends in demand abroad and at home have led to a further improvement in Hungarys external balance with the current account registering a substantial surplus since mid. This uneven pattern may continue in the medium term. The Council therefore expects the economy to operate without reliance on foreign funding in coming years. The increase in CPI inflation in the past three months was attributable mainly to rises in the prices of items excluded from the core measure. Services price inflation declined to a historic low. Taking all these factors into account the Monetary Council continues to judge that inflation may fall below the target over the next two years albeit at a somewhat slower pace than earlier expected. Global investor sentiment weakened over the past month as concerns about the sustainability of the path of government debt in a number of developed economies again came to the fore. At the same time assessments of risks associated with Hungarian financial assets barely changed. The significant improvement in Hungarys external balance has reduced the vulnerability of the economy however the high level of debt and weak indicators of economic activity continue to pose risks. In order to reduce the countrys vulnerability to external shocks it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined longterm sustainable fiscal policy. Based on the above considerations the Monetary Council has decided to reduce interest rates by basis points. The Council judges that the room for manoeuvre in interest rate policy has narrowed due to increased uncertainty in international financial markets. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .,62,2010
2010-03-29,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from March. In the Monetary Councils judgement Hungarian growth is likely to resume this year as the economy recovers from the sharp downturn of. Although the increases in indirect taxes and administered prices are still putting upward pressure on prices inflation has increasingly been driven by weak domestic demand. In consequence CPI inflation is expected to drop below the Banks mediumterm target next year. There remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. The recovery in the domestic economy is likely to lag behind that in the global economy and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Growth may continue to reflect the structural divergences of. Following the sharp decline last year consumption is unlikely to increase materially while exports are expected to pick up markedly. Weak demand continues to have the greatest impact on developments in the prices of products shaping the mediumterm outlook for inflation. Services inflation has been falling steadily. In February tradable prices reversed their increase in the previous month. Taking all these factors into account the Council continues to judge that inflation may begin to fall back towards the target from the middle of and then dip below it in. Global investor sentiment has improved in the past month associated with a significant reduction in risk premia on Hungarian financial assets. Although investor concerns over the sustainability of government debt in some euro area countries have remained they have not had a considerable impact on perceptions of risks associated with the economies of Central and Eastern Europe. In the Councils judgement however there are questions over the sustainability of the recovery. Although the significant improvement in the external balance has reduced Hungarys external vulnerability its high aggregate indebtedness and generally weak indicators of economic activity continue to pose risks. In order to reduce the countrys vulnerability to external shocks it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined longterm sustainable fiscal policy. Based on the above considerations the Monetary Council has decided to lower the central bank base rate by basis points. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it.

2010-04-26,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from April. In the Monetary Councils judgement Hungarian growth is likely to resume this year as the economy recovers from the sharp downturn of. Inflation is expected to fall below the Banks target next year reflecting the effect of weak domestic demand. There remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. The Hungarian economy is likely to continue to show the structural divergences in activity observed in. Exports are expected to pick up in contrast to domestic demand which is unlikely to grow materially this year. In consequence the recovery in the domestic economy is likely to lag behind that in the global economy and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Developments in the prices of products determining the mediumterm outlook for inflation continue to reflect the downward effect on prices of weak domestic demand. Services inflation has been falling steadily for some time. The tradables price index fell in March for the second consecutive month. In light of these developments the Council continues to judge that inflation may begin to fall back towards the target from the middle of this year and then dip below it next year. Global investor sentiment has improved further in the past month. This has also been reflected in the fall in risk premia on Hungarian financial assets. However investor concerns over the sustainability of government debt in some euro area countries have remained posing a threat to the persistence of the improvement in global conditions. The improvement in the countrys external balance has led to a reduction in Hungarys earlier external vulnerability however its high aggregate indebtedness and generally weak indicators of economic activity continue to pose risks. In order to reduce the countrys vulnerability to external shocks it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined longterm sustainable fiscal policy. Based on the above considerations the Monetary Council has decided to lower the central bank base rate by basis points. Even though justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions about the risks associated with the economy allow it. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May .,64,2010
2010-05-31,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Council also discussed the Banks June Quarterly Report on Inflation. Latest data suggest that the Hungarian economy has begun to recover more strongly than expected and the country is also likely to have emerged from recession in early. Nevertheless there remains a considerable degree of slack in the economy constraining companies ability to raise prices. Due to the downward effect on prices of weak domestic demand core inflation may remain well below the target. However as a result of global energy price inflation the consumer price index may settle around the Banks target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy higher than previously forecast. Hungarys risk assessment deteriorated in the past month due to global developments and the future outlook is surrounded by significant uncertainty. Last years structural divergences within the economy may remain domestic demand growth is likely to lag behind the pickup in exports and is only expected to make a material contribution to overall economic growth from. In terms of the longerterm outlook uncertainty about growth prospects in Hungarys major trading partner economies implies a downside risk to domestic growth. Concerns over the sustainability of public sector debts in several EU countries require substantial fiscal adjustment by governments which in turn may slow growth in Hungarys external demand. The outlook for inflation is also shaped by rising economic activity abroad and an accompanying increase in energy prices as well as by the slow recovery of domestic demand. Weak domestic demand will continue to put significant downward pressure on prices over the next months. Core inflation is therefore expected to remain well below the target. This effect however may be partly offset by rises in energy prices due to the strengthening of global activity the depreciation of the euro and increases in administered prices. In the recovery of domestic demand may lead to an increase in core inflation. As a result of all these factors inflation may remain around in the second half of this year after the effects of the VAT increase drop out of the index and may only edge back to around the target in. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased markedly in the wake of global developments. Sovereign debt problems in a number of euro area Member States and the associated concerns over the prospects of the euro area have resulted in a reduction in risk appetite among investors worldwide. That in turn has had an adverse impact on perceptions of the risks associated with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe including Hungary. Considering that fiscal sustainability has become the focus of international investors attention it is particularly important to maintain disciplined longterm sustainable fiscal policies. This is especially relevant for countries with high debt levels such as Hungary. In light of increased perceptions of risk associated with Hungarian financial assets and inflation risks the Monetary Council has decided to leave interest unchanged. Interest rates may only be reduced further if the outlook for inflation as well as perceptionsofrisk allow. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June .,65,2010
2010-06-21,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council left the central bank base rate of unchanged reviewing economic and financial developments. Following last years deep recession the Hungarian economy showed growth at the beginning of the year. As a result of subdued domestic demand inflation is expected to fall to the MNBs mediumterm objective next year. As a result of global and countryspecific developments Hungarys risk perception has worsened over the past month and future prospects are subject to considerable uncertainty. Q detailed GDP data confirmed our picture of growth. Domestic activity may continue to be characterized by the structural duality observed last year domestic demand is only lagging behind the recovery in exports and is expected to make a significant contribution to economic growth only from onwards. The outlook for inflation is also shaped by the acceleration of external economic activity and the related rise in energy prices as well as the duality of domestic demand which is only slowly rising. Inflation figures for May also confirm that weak domestic demand will continue to exert a significant downward pressure on prices over the next year and a half. Due to the impact of commodity prices on items other than core inflation the mediumterm inflation target can only be met next year. The recent decline in inflation expectations of economic agents together with a more protracted decline in the consumer price index and a gradual recovery in economic activity risks jeopardizing the achievement of the target. Fiscal sustainability concerns continue to negatively impact global risk appetite. Hungarys investor sentiment has worsened especially due to the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy. In this market environment longterm sustainable fiscal policy is paramount. The Monetary Council welcomes the Governments stated commitment to meeting the deficit target and considers it important to work out implementation details as soon as possible. Further government action to secure the deficit target for international organizations could contribute to improving risk perception. In view of the deteriorating risk assessment of domestic financial assets and inflationary risks the Monetary Council decided to keep the key interest rate level.,66,2010
2010-07-19,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Council notes with regret that the completion of the review of Hungarys existing credit line with the IMF and the EU has been postponed as more time is needed for the Government to draw up a programme which is consistent with the approved Convergence Programme and the recommendations to correct the countrys excessive deficit leads to a lasting improvement in fiscal sustainability and is based on structural measures. It is reassuring that the Government has declared its commitment to continuing the fiscal consolidation process. It is important that measures are taken both to reduce the government deficit on a sustained basis and improve the economys growth potential. Meeting the deficit targets considered low compared with those in other countries of the European Union may help place the public sector debttoGDP ratio on a declining path. The domestic economy has started to grow again which supports the continuation of the fiscal consolidation process. The Monetary Council maintains its view that domestic economic activity continues to be shaped by the divergent trends in external and domestic demand. The latest data for industrial production and the trade balance are consistent with the view that the strength of external activity has been the driving force behind domestic economic growth. However domestic demand growth is lagging behind the pickup in exports and is only expected to make a material contribution to overall economic growth from. The inflation outlook is also being determined by the contrast between rising economic activity abroad and the further decline in domestic consumption demand. Recent inflation data continue to suggest that weak domestic demand will exert significant downward pressure on prices in the period ahead but looking forward the continued weakness of the forint may generate inflationary pressure. In terms of meeting the target in a further risk is that inflation expectations will not be anchored due to persistently abovetarget inflation. In the current unfavourable international environment the risk premia on Hungarian financial assets continue to be high and volatile in part reflecting concerns over the domestic fiscal path. The Monetary Council will make efforts to stem any excessive fluctuations in the forint exchange rate in the period ahead. The Council has therefore decided to continue the conversion of EU funds in the domestic market. A sustained increase in risk premia may make it necessary to raise the central bank base rate. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August .,67,2010
2010-08-23,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Council also discussed the Banks August Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy may begin to emerge from recession in however the level of output is expected to be below potential throughout the entire forecast period and the unemployment rate is likely to remain elevated. Somewhat differently from the Report projection the Council judges that despite the set of cost shocks currently hitting the economy inflation may return to close to the inflation target due to persistently weak domestic demand. In recent months investors perceptions of risks facing the Hungarian economy have not reflected the improvement in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The shortterm outlook for domestic growth continues to be shaped by the divergent trends in buoyant economic activity abroad and weak domestic demand. Strongerthanexpected external demand has been the primary source of growth in Hungary. Household consumption is expected to remain subdued this year depressed by high monthly instalments on foreign currency loans due to the weaker exchange rate and by persistently high unemployment. Domestic demand may also contribute to growth from but the risks are judged by the Council to be on the downside. Despite the downward pressure on prices from weak domestic demand the risk that the inflation target will not be met has increased. The recent weakness of the forint and rises in commodity and food prices may initially feed through to an increase primarily in the prices of items excluded from the core measure of inflation. In the medium term however core inflation may also begin to rise in response to the recovery in demand and increased cost pressures. In terms of meeting the target there is an upside risk that economic agents inflation expectations will not be well anchored due to persistently abovetarget inflation. Global appetite for risk has on balance increased in recent months contributing to a reduction in perceptions of the risks associated with other economies of the CEE region. However Hungarys risk premium has not fallen significantly. The Governments commitment to maintaining a sustainable path for the fiscal budget is key to preserving investor confidence. In light of inflation risks and output persistently below its potential level the Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The extent to which persistently low demand will reduce the passthrough of cost shocks is a source of uncertainty in assessing the outlook for inflation. If inflation risks remain or there is a lasting increase in perceptions of risks facing the Hungarian economy it may be necessary to raise the base rate. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .,68,2010
2010-09-27,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy has begun to emerge from recession in however output is likely to return to its potential level only slowly. Inflation is expected to ease back towards the Banks inflation target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy due to the persistent weakness of domestic demand. Heightened perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy reflect the uncertainty felt by market participants. The nearterm outlook for domestic growth continues to be shaped by the divergent trends in robust economic activity abroad and weak domestic demand. Strong external demand has been the main driver of Hungarian growth this year. Consumption demand has been flat because of households uncertain income prospects and rises in monthly instalments on foreign currency loans and is only likely to contribute to growth from. The latest inflation data were consistent with the baseline projection in the latest Quarterly Report on Inflation. The effects of the weaker exchange rate are not yet reflected in consumer prices but rises in food prices may add to inflationary pressure over the short term. Earnings data released since publication of the Report were more benign than expected. In the medium term however accumulated cost pressures at companies exercising restraint in their pricing policies may have an upward effect on inflation as demand gradually recovers. In terms of meeting the target there is an upside risk that economic agents inflation expectations will not be well anchored due to persistently abovetarget inflation. Global appetite for risk and perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have been volatile over the past month. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the forint in recent months has placed a particularly heavy burden on households with loans denominated in francs. Borrowers declining ability to repay their debts is likely to lead to a fall in bank earnings and a deterioration in credit quality which in turn may prompt banks to reduce the supply of credit. The Governments declared commitment to meeting the deficit target for is key to preserving investor confidence. Information on the Governments actions designed to meet the deficit target could contribute to an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of recent developments in inflation and a prolonged period of output below potential. The extent to which persistently weak domestic demand will dampen the passthrough of cost shocks into prices continues to be a source of uncertainty in assessing the outlook for inflation. If upside risks to inflation materialise or there is an increase once again in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy it may be necessary to raise the central bank base rate.

2010-10-25,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy has begun to emerge from recession in the course of however output is likely to return to its potential level only slowly. Weak domestic demand continues to exert a dampening influence on inflation. The proposed government measures may result in a marked change in the outlook for the economy adding to the upside risks to inflation and increasing uncertainty in the investment environment. The Monetary Council will assess the likely quantitative impact of these measures in light of the November Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the short term buoyant external demand may continue to be the engine of growth for the Hungarian economy. Growth in employment and the proposed cut in personal income tax rates may help to strengthen consumption demand next year. The introduction of windfall taxes may reduce the predictability of the taxation system which in turn may weigh on firms investment intentions. Recent inflation data suggest that the passthrough of the weaker exchange rate into consumer prices may be slower than expected which however may be offset in the short term by an increase in food prices. In the medium term accumulated cost pressures at companies exercising restraint in their pricing policies may have an upward effect on inflation as demand gradually recovers which may also be reflected in core inflation developments. The possibility that some industries will pass the cost of the windfall tax on to consumers may also put upward pressure on inflation. This effect may be mitigated if private sector firms take account of the Governments personal income tax measures in setting next years wages which could lead to a fall in their wage bill. With respect to meeting the inflation target there continues to be an upside risk to the extent that economic agents inflation expectations are not firmly anchored due to persistently abovetarget inflation. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have improved slightly over the past month due partly to the increase in global risk appetite and partly to the Governments continued commitment to meeting the deficit target of. In the Councils view while the proposed government measures are expected to have an overall positive influence on labour supply they will reduce the predictability of the economic environment and therefore their impact on longerterm growth is uncertain. While the government deficit on an ESA basis will fall the structural position which is a key factor in terms of longerterm developments will deteriorate significantly because the effects of the tax changes resulting in persistent revenue shortfalls will be offset by temporary measures proposed to improve the fiscal balance. Consequently achieving a longterm sustainable path for the fiscal budget will require additional structural measures on the expenditure side. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the uncertainty about the inflation outlook and a prolonged period of output below potential. If upside risks to inflation materialise or there is a sustained increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy an increase in the central bank base rate may be necessary.

2010-11-29,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from November. The Monetary Council discussed the MNBs November Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to recover from recession over the forecast period however output will remain below its potential level. Inflation is expected to rise in the short term due to significant costpush shocks hitting the economy. Under unchanged monetary conditions inflation may remain above the target for a sustained period. In the Councils view there are risks that inflation expectations will rise due to persistently abovetarget inflation and that the costpush shocks will have secondround inflationary effects. Hungarian economic growth continues to be driven by industrial sales on the back of strong external demand. Labour demand in the exporting sectors has increased which has led to a rise in employment. Domestic demand may also begin to pick up in the course of. Household consumption is expected to increase due to the reduction in the personal income tax burden and improvements in employment. Investment is expected to increase as a result of a couple of projects undertaken in the manufacturing sector. However investment activity may be restrained by heightened uncertainty surrounding the current business environment due to the imposition of sectorspecific windfall taxes. Incoming data are consistent with the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to have a disciplinary effect on firms price and wagesetting decisions. The passthrough of the depreciation of the exchange rate during the summer has turned out to be smaller than previously expected. Loose labour market conditions allow firms to restore their profitability by offering moderate wage increases rather than by raising prices. However the economy has been hit by adverse costpush shocks. There has been a broadly based increase in unprocessed food prices which is likely to feed through into processed food prices. The passing on of some of the windfall tax imposed on certain sectors to customers may generate additional inflationary pressure. As a result of these factors and assuming unchanged monetary conditions inflation in may significantly exceed the target and may remain above it in. The Council notes that it is important that price and wagesetting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions despite the temporary upward effects on inflation. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased recently due partly to the fall in global risk appetite and partly to countryspecific factors and particularly to a decline in the predictability of the economic environment. The latter is also reflected by the fact that since the middle of October Hungarys risk premium has risen by more than in other countries with similar risk profiles. The Monetary Council has decided to raise the base rate in light of inflation remaining persistently above the target as well as the upside risks to inflation. It may be necessary to increase the base rate further in the coming months in order to meet the inflation target. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,71,2010
2010-12-20,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from December. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to recover from recession over the next two years however output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to considerably exceed the Banks target in the coming quarters due to significant costpush shocks hitting the economy. The Council judges that there is a risk that in the absence of monetary policy tightening inflation expectations will rise due to persistently abovetarget inflation and the costpush shocks will have secondround inflationary effects. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth however recent evidence suggests that a recovery in consumption was under way in Q. Household consumption is likely to pick up further due to the easing of tax burdens on personal incomes and improvements in employment. In the Councils view investment is only likely to materially contribute to growth from next year. Investment by companies will rise on the back of FDI flows into manufacturing which however will be partly offset by heightened uncertainty about the business environment. Movements in the prices of industrial goods and services reinforce the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wage setters. However the economy has been hit by adverse costpush shocks. The broadly based increase in unprocessed food prices has been feeding through into processed food prices. The passing of some of the sectorspecific taxes on to customers and rises in fuel prices may generate additional inflationary pressure. As a result of these factors inflation in may be significantly above the target and it is doubtful whether the target will be met in in the absence of monetary policy tightening. The Council notes that it is important that the price and wagesetting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions despite the temporary upward effects on inflation. Perceptions of the risks associated with Hungarian financial assets have not fallen despite the improvement in investor sentiment towards emerging markets. The latest downgrading of Hungarys sovereign debt and the protracted rise in the countrys risk premium relative to other CEE countries reflect concerns over fiscal sustainability and the predictability of the economic environment. The Monetary Council has decided to raise the base rate in light of inflation remaining persistently above the target as well as the upside risks to inflation. In the coming months the Council will decide whether to raise interest rates after weighing up the balance of inflation risks. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on January .,72,2010
2011-01-24,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from January. In the Monetary Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to recover from recession over the next two years however output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the Banks target in the coming quarters due to significant costpush shocks hitting the economy. In terms of the mediumterm outlook for inflation the main risk is that inflation expectations are unanchored due to a prolonged period of abovetarget inflation and therefore the adverse cost shocks may have secondround inflationary effects. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth this year with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. The easing of tax burdens on personal incomes and improvements in employment may stimulate household consumption. Large individual investment projects currently underway presage a pickup in corporate investment however heightened uncertainty about the business environment may be a factor pressing down on investment growth. The low level of core inflation and moderate earnings growth in the private sector are consistent with the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wagesetting behaviour. However the economy has been hit by adverse costpush shocks. Rises in unprocessed food and oil prices have led to inflationary pressure in the economy. This may be aggravated by the partial passing on to customers of the cost of sectoral levies. As a result of these factors inflation may be significantly above the target this year and it is doubtful whether the target would be met in in the absence of further policy tightening. The Council notes that it is important that the price and wagesetting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions despite the temporary upward effects on prices. The continued high level of the risk premium on Hungarian financial assets reflects market concerns about the sustainability of the fiscal position and the predictability of the economic environment. The Council has decided to raise the base rate in view of the upside risks to inflation. In the coming months the Council will decide whether to raise interest rates again after considering upside risks to inflation. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February. The Councils assessment of performance in meeting the inflation target in The Banks inflation target was not met in. CPI inflation remained significantly above over the year as a whole. The low level of core inflation at below from the second half of the year reflects the effects of weak domestic demand. Increases in indirect taxes announced in the previous year continued to have an upward impact on prices in H however even after most of those effects wore off inflation has not fallen back close to the target due mainly to rises in food and other commodity prices. Consequently the rate of consumer price inflation exceeded considerably the MNBs continuous target for the fourth consecutive year. Since the introduction of the continuous target on January the Hungarian economy has been hit by a number of shocks which have raised the consumer price level at the same time as reducing wholeeconomy output. In view of the real economic costs of monetary tightening and the output gap assumed to be negative at the time the shocks hit the Bank decided not to offset the direct upward effect on prices of those shocks. The repeated cost shocks prevented inflation expectations from stabilising at around the target in the absence of robust monetary policy response. The elevated level of inflation expectations in addition to the cost shocks may be another factor explaining why price stability could not be achieved in Hungary despite the historically low level of capacity utilisation. Past international experience suggests that small open economies both advanced and emerging ones have succeeded in bringing down inflation expectations and stabilising them at a low level by using an inflation targeting regime. In order for the inflation targeting regime to be successful in Hungary monetary policy should focus on anchoring inflation expectations and making appropriate welltimed responses to future inflation shocks as its main priorities.

2011-02-21,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Monetary Councils judgement the pickup in economic activity is likely to continue over the next two years however the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the Banks target in the coming quarters due to the significant costpush shocks hitting the economy. In terms of the mediumterm outlook for inflation the main risk is that expectations are unanchored due to a prolonged period of abovetarget inflation and therefore the adverse cost shocks may have secondround inflationary effects. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth this year with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. The easing of tax burdens on personal incomes and the expected slow improvement in employment may stimulate household consumption however tight credit conditions and the sustained rise in commodity prices may act to restrain consumption. Large individual investment projects currently underway point to a pickup in wholeeconomy fixed investment but heightened uncertainty about the business environment and weak lending activity may press down on investment growth. The low level of core inflation and moderate earnings growth in the private sector are consistent with the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wagesetting behaviour. However the economy has been hit by adverse costpush shocks. Rises in unprocessed food and fuel prices have led to the buildup of inflationary pressure in the economy. As a result inflation may remain significantly above the target this year. The extent to which the cost shocks feed through to consumer prices will be an important factor influencing movements in inflation over the medium term.The Council notes that it is important that the price and wagesetting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions despite the temporary upward effects on prices. Potential increases in wages inconsistent with corporate performance may pose a threat to meeting the inflation target as well as to job security.Although risk premia on Hungarian financial assets have fallen markedly in the past month which may reflect lower perceptions of risks associated with some highdebt countries of the euro area and the slight recovery in confidence in domestic economic policy they continue to be high compared with those in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In the coming months the nature of the longterm structural budget measures to be announced by the Government may be a key factor shaping perceptions of the risks associated with the economy in addition to global factors.In the Monetary Councils judgement the policy tightening implemented in the past three months is likely to help bring inflation back close to the target after the firstround effects of the cost shocks wear off. The Council has therefore decided to leave interest rates unchanged. In the coming months the Council will decide whether to raise interest rates again after considering upside risks to inflation.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,74,2011
2011-03-28,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. Members discussed the March issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up gradually over the forecast horizon however the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the Banks target in the short term due to the costpush shocks hitting the economy but may fall back close to the target by the end of next year even without further monetary tightening. Looking ahead inflation is likely to continue to be dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wagesetting behaviour. On the other hand the economy has been hit by adverse costpush shocks the effects of which are expected to feed through to core inflation in the short term. According to the latest available data however the extent of this passthrough has been smaller than previously. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating earnings growth rather than by raising prices. The recent interest rate increases have been successful in reducing possible secondround effects of the cost shocks. On balance therefore inflation in is likely to remain significantly above the Banks target and then fall back to settle around it towards the end of next year. The Council judges that it may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation in. The Councils collective view that it is important that administered prices only change to the extent justified by cost increases and welcomes the Governments commitment in this area. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth this year with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension fund contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to household consumption with the reduction in the tax burden on personal incomes expected to provide a sustained stimulus. However the Governments planned fiscal adjustment measures may lead to a sharp fall in household disposable income in. If maintained over a sustained period current tight credit conditions in the household market may weigh down on consumption demand growth and reinforce the disinflationary effects from the real economy. Increased business uncertainty due to tight lending conditions the effects of windfall taxes and changes to corporate income tax regulations has been a drag on corporate investment activity recently. There is a significant risk that the productive capacity of the economy will expand more slowly over a prolonged period in response to weaker private sector investment. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy changed little in March following the improvement in previous months. The announcement of the Governments fiscal adjustment measures left risk premia broadly unaffected as it had already been priced in by the market. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. It is justified to maintain interest rates at their current level as long as economic developments are consistent with the path outlined in the Report. If incoming data suggest a greater passthrough from the cost shocks it may be necessary to tighten current monetary conditions in response to upside risks to inflation. However a slowerthanexpected recovery in lending and weakerthanexpected domestic demand may warrant a reduction in interest rates in the medium term. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,75,2011
2011-04-18,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up gradually over the next months however the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the target in the short term due to the costpush shocks hitting the economy but may fall back close to by the end of next year even without further monetary tightening. Looking ahead inflation is likely to continue to be dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand the economy has been hit by adverse costpush shocks which are expected to feed through to core inflation in the short term. On the other hand weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wagesetting behaviour. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating earnings growth rather than by raising prices. The Councils past interest rate increases may also reduce possible secondround effects of the cost shocks. On balance therefore inflation is likely to remain significantly above in before falling back to around the target towards the end of next year as the firstround effects wear off. The Council judges that it may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation in. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. The rate of household consumption growth is expected to continue to be determined by the slow recovery in employment and subdued real earnings growth. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension fund contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to consumption with the reduction in the tax burden on personal incomes expected to provide a sustained stimulus. However the Governments planned fiscal adjustment measures may lead to a sharp fall in disposable income in. If maintained over a sustained period current tight credit conditions in the household market may continue to hold back the recovery in consumption demand and reinforce the disinflationary effects from the real economy. The significant amount of spare capacity in the economy and uncertainty around the outlook for growth are impeding the recovery in corporate investment. Increased business uncertainty due to tight credit conditions and the effects of windfall taxes also acts as a drag on investment activity. The Monetary Council judges that there is a significant risk that the productive capacity of the economy will expand more slowly over a prolonged period in response to weaker private sector investment activity which in turn may dampen the disinflationary effects of weak domestic demand. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have fallen recently as reflected in a decline in risk premia and an increase in demand for forintdenominated assets. In large part this is likely to have been driven by higher global investor demand for financial assets of countries of the CEE region. However it is difficult to judge how long this improvement will continue. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. It is justified to maintain interest rates at their current level as long as economic developments are consistent with the projection in the Banks March Quarterly Report on Inflation. If incoming data suggest a greater passthrough from the cost shocks it may be necessary to tighten current monetary conditions in response to upside risks to inflation. However a slowerthanexpected recovery in lending to households and weakerthanexpected domestic demand may warrant a reduction in interest rates in the medium term.

2011-05-16,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up gradually over the next quarters however the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be significantly above the target in the short term due to the costpush shocks hitting the economy but may fall back close to by the end of next year even without further policy tightening. Inflation is likely to continue to be dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand commodity prices particularly oil and agricultural prices continued to rise the upward effect of which was reflected in higher consumer prices. In addition core inflation picked up more sharply than the Council anticipated reflecting a strongerthanexpected passthrough of the marked rise in agricultural prices to food prices. On the other hand developments in services and traded goods prices suggest that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wagesetting behaviour. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating earnings growth rather than by raising prices. The Councils past interest rate increases may reduce possible secondround effects of the cost shocks. As a result of these factors inflation is likely to be significantly above this year and then to fall back to settle around the target towards the end of next year as the firstround effects wear off. External demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth in the coming quarters. There is no sign yet of a pickup in domestic demand. Looking ahead the rate of household consumption growth is expected to continue to be fundamentally determined by the slow recovery in employment and subdued earnings growth. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension fund contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to household consumption with the reduction in the tax burden on personal incomes expected to provide a sustained stimulus. However the Governments planned fiscal adjustment measures may lead to a sharp fall in household disposable income in. If maintained over a sustained period current tight credit conditions in the household market may hold back the recovery in consumption demand and reinforce the disinflationary effects from the real economy. The significant amount of spare capacity in the economy and uncertainty around the external economic environment and the recovery in consumption are impeding the recovery in corporate investment. In addition tight lending conditions and increased business uncertainty continue to act as a drag on investment activity. The Monetary Council judges that there is a significant risk that the productive capacity of the economy will expand more slowly over a prolonged period in response to weaker private sector investment activity which in turn may dampen the disinflationary effects of weak domestic demand. There has been a reduction recently in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy as reflected in a fall in risk premia and increased demand for forintdenominated assets. This may partly be explained by increased global investor demand for financial assets of emerging market economies. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. There remain both upside and downside risks to inflation. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,77,2011
2011-06-20,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Council discussed and commented on the June issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Councils judgement the recovery of the Hungarian economy is likely to continue over the next two years however the level of output will remain below its potential throughout the period. Domestic demand is expected to recover only slowly and gradually. Consequently inflation may fall back to by the end of even without policy tightening despite the cost shocks hitting the economy. Inflation has increasingly been dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand continued rises in commodity prices are feeding through into core inflation in the short term. On the other hand the disciplining effect on price and wagesetting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment is likely to become the dominant influence as the effects of the cost shocks wear off. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating wage growth. As a result inflation is likely to be materially above this year and then to fall back to the target towards the end of next year even without policy tightening. It may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation by the end of. In the Councils judgement domestic demand growth is expected to recover only slowly. The latest data show little sign yet of a pickup in household consumption. Indebted households may continue to adjust their balance sheets and maintain their high propensity to save for longer than previously expected. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension funds contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to household consumption. By contrast the slow recovery in employment and the reduction in government expenditure required to stabilise fiscal balance are likely to lead to a fall in household disposable income in the short term and are only expected to result in higher income growth over the longer term through a sustained rise in employment. The factors influencing the recovery in private sector investment are weak domestic demand tight credit conditions and the effect of windfall taxes. Although a couple of large individual investment projects in manufacturing are likely to help bring about a recovery private sector investment is only expected to increase materially from mid. In the Councils judgement the decline in private sector investment in the past few years points to a persistently lower output path than previously expected. External demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth in the short term due to the slowerthanexpected recovery of domestic demand. Global economic activity is expected to slow slightly but its effect on Hungarian exports may be offset by the implementation of largescale investment projects mainly in the car industry. The trade surplus reflecting strong export growth and weak imports due to subdued domestic demand is likely to make a significant contribution to economic growth over the next two years. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have recently been shaped by the improvement in sentiment towards emerging market economies. Concerns over the sustainability of public debt in some euroarea periphery countries intensified however this had only limited impact on risk premia in countries of Central and Eastern Europe which was viewed as a positive development. Positive market reactions to the latest update of the Governments Convergence Programme and the interest rate premium on the forint may also have contributed to relative stability. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. Inflation is likely to be above target in the short term due to costpush pressures stemming from the rise in commodity prices. However owing to the disciplining effect on price and wagesetting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment the inflation target can be achieved at the end of by maintaining interest rates at their current level over a sustained period. There are both upside and downside risks to the baseline projection for inflation with the Council assigning different weights to them. Developments in commodity prices are a main source of uncertainty for the future course of interest rate policy. Further sustained increases in the prices of oil and agricultural products may make it necessary to increase interest rates in order to reduce inflationary pressures. A potential further decline in the risk premium on the forint in response to the fiscal adjustment may ease inflationary pressures through an appreciation of the forint exchange rate which in turn may provide scope for an easing of monetary conditions in the medium term. However the protracted debt crisis in the euroarea periphery may have adverse effects on perceptions about the risks associated with forint assets which in turn may warrant an increase in interest rates. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,78,2011
2011-07-26,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to pick up slowly over the next two years however the level of output will remain below its potential throughout the period. Domestic demand is expected to recover only gradually. Consequently inflation may fall back to by the end of even without policy tightening despite the cost shocks hitting the economy. The decline in consumer prices was in line with the monetary Councils previous expectations. Falling unprocessed food prices had a dampening influence on overall consumer price inflation however core inflation continued to rise as a result of higher commodity prices. The restraining effect on price and wagesetting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment in addition to moderate movements in administered prices is likely to be a key determinant of inflation as the effects of the cost shocks wear off. It may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation by the end of. External demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth in the short term with domestic demand growth likely to recover only slowly. The pace of global economic activity is expected to ease slightly but this effect on Hungarian exports may be offset by the implementation of largescale investment projects mainly in the car industry. The trade surplus is likely to remain high reflecting strong export growth and weak imports due to subdued domestic demand. The latest data on household consumption show little sign of a pickup. Disbursements of real returns on private pension funds are likely to provide a temporary boost to consumption. However the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc may lead to an increase in monthly instalments on existing household debt. If the strength of the franc were to persist it would take longer for households to adjust their balance sheets which may act as a drag on consumption growth. This in turn may result in lower inflation. The generalised increase in risk aversion due to the escalation of the euroarea sovereign debt crisis also had an impact on countries of the CEE region including Hungary. The deepening of the crisis could lead to persistently high risk aversion which would be reflected in increased yields on government securities and interbank rates as well as in a depreciation of the forint against the currencies of developed countries. In addition a deepening of the crisis could cause a slowdown in euroarea activity which would negatively affect the outlook for Hungarian economic growth through lower external demand. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. In terms of the Councils future interest rate policy a prolongation of the euroarea debt crisis represents the most important source of risk. Over the period ahead the Councils interest rate decisions may be influenced by the extent to which measures to solve the euroarea debt crisis will prove successful and by expected developments in domestic inflation. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,79,2011
2011-08-23,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement the recovery of the Hungarian economy is likely to continue over the next two years however the level of output will remain below its potential throughout the period. Domestic demand is expected to remain subdued. Consequently inflation may settle around the Banks target by the end of even without policy tightening despite the cost shocks hitting the economy. The decline in consumer prices in recent months was in line with the Monetary Councils expectation. Inflation fell back to close to in July partly as a result of a decline in unprocessed food prices and strict measures taken against attempts to raise administered prices. By contrast core inflation continued to rise due to the passthrough of higher commodity prices. The restraining effect on price and wagesetting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment is likely to be a key determinant of inflation as the firstround effects of the cost shocks wear off however consumer price inflation may remain above target in the coming months. It may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation in the medium term. The picture painted by the latest data on economic activity was weaker than the Monetary Council expected. External demand has recently been the main driver of economic growth however there is some evidence that global activity is slowing. The effect of the global slowdown on Hungarian exports may be partly offset by the implementation of largescale investment projects mainly in the car industry. The trade surplus is expected to remain high as export growth slows and imports weaken reflecting subdued domestic demand. The Council maintains its view that household consumption is unlikely to pick up significantly in the near future. It may take longer for households to adjust their balance sheets as a result of the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc which in turn may delay the recovery in consumption growth. Tight credit conditions and uncertainty surrounding the global economic environment and domestic consumption continue to impede the recovery in corporate investment. Hungary has also been affected by the decline in global risk appetite due to the euroarea sovereign debt crisis and uncertainty surrounding the outlook for growth in developed countries. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. Over the period ahead the Councils interest rate decisions may be influenced by the success of measures to solve the euroarea debt crisis in addition to expected developments in domestic inflation. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,80,2011
2011-09-20,The Monetary Council discussed and commented on the September issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to remain subdued over the next two years with the level of output remaining below its potential throughout the period. Mediumterm upside risks to inflation have fallen due to weak domestic demand. Inflation may fall back to by the beginning of as the effects of cost shocks and increases in indirect taxes wear off. The Monetary Council is closely monitoring developments in taxadjusted core inflation in addition to movements in the consumer price index. The deteriorating outlook for economic activity points to a decline in inflation from the demand side. Higher commodity and fuel prices in the first half of the year fed through to core inflation as reflected mainly in rises in processed food prices. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to raise the consumer price index considerably for a short period however inflationary pressures from the demand side continue to be extremely low. Subdued inflationary pressures from the demand side are likely to become the dominant factor in developments in annual CPI inflation as the impact of the cost shocks and the increase in indirect taxes gradually fade. In the Councils judgement the outlook for Hungarian growth has deteriorated significantly in the past quarter. Domestic demand is likely to be persistently low reflecting the prolonged process of balance sheet adjustment by households and the further tightening in credit conditions. It is unlikely that the reduction in personal income taxation and disbursements to members of their private pension fund contributions this year will be sufficient to boost domestic household consumption which has been subdued for some time. The high degree of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for incomes and high levels of debt are impeding the recovery in consumption growth. Investment activity is likely to be extremely subdued due to uncertainty in the business climate the tightening in credit conditions and the deterioration in the outlook for activity. Large individual investment projects implemented in manufacturing will only partly offset weak investment activity. Service sector investment is unlikely to pick up due to a significant margin of spare capacity. Household investment is likely to reach its trough at the end of this year but is expected to remain flat thereafter. The slowdown in global growth and the prolonged problems of the European banking sector point to a more adverse external environment in Hungarys export markets which is likely to weigh on domestic export growth. However the large investment projects mainly in the car industry will partly offset this effect as they gradual start to produce output. As a result Hungarys export market share may rise in. Exports are likely to remain the driver of growth over the next two years despite the slowdown in external demand. Risk premia have risen in the past month and the forint exchange rate has weakened. The increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy was mainly accounted for by the deteriorating outlook for global growth and the protracted debt crisis of the euro area. The option for households to repay their foreign currency debt at belowmarket rate represents a significant source of uncertainty in terms of Hungarys risk perceptions. There is a risk that the programme will cause a major setback in the domestic banking sectors ability to lend and companies reduced access to bank credit may lead to a further deterioration in the outlook for Hungarian growth. In the Councils judgement increased volatility in financial markets observed recently may persist for some time. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. Uncertainty in financial markets warrants a waitandsee policy stance. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on October. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,81,2011
2011-10-25,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to remain subdued over the next two years with the level of output remaining below its potential throughout the period. In the short run inflation is likely to pick up as a result of certain Government measures and a depreciating exchange rate. It is then expected to moderate in the weak demand environment as the effects of the cost shocks and indirect tax increases wear off. However there is considerable uncertainty around the degree and time path of disinflation as developments in inflation have been affected by several shocks in the short term. In the Councils judgement the outlook for growth has worsened significantly recently. Consumption demand is likely to be persistently low reflecting the protracted process of balance sheet adjustment by households uncertain income prospects and the further tightening in credit conditions. Significant fiscal adjustment next year is also likely to act as a brake on domestic demand growth. In the uncertain economic environment the tightening in credit conditions and the weaker outlook for growth are likely to be a drag on investment activity. Corporate profitability is expected to fall reflecting rising labour costs due to the increase in the minimum wage and the tightening in the rules on writeoffs of losses incurred in previous years. As a result corporate investment activity may fall in which will be only partly offset by a couple of large individual investment projects implemented in manufacturing and the use of EU development funds. Service sector investment is unlikely to pick up due to the significant margin of spare capacity. Household investment may reach its trough at the end of this year but is expected to remain flat thereafter. Domestic lending continues to make little contribution to economic growth. Rolling over shortterm external funding has become more expensive and difficult for banks due to the sovereign debt problems in the euroarea periphery. In addition banks capital position has been deteriorating due to early repayments by households of their foreign currencydenominated mortgages. These factors may lead to a further tightening of credit supply constraints. The slowdown in global activity concerns about debt sustainability in some euroarea periphery countries and the vulnerability of the financial system point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungarys export markets which in turn is likely to dampen export growth. Despite the slowdown in external demand exports are likely to remain the main driver of subdued domestic growth over the next two years. Over the past month Hungarian risk premia have remained elevated due mainly to the deteriorating outlook for global growth and the protracted debt crisis of the euro area. The decline in domestic banks capital buffers due to the option for households to repay their foreign currency debt at belowmarket rates represents a significant source of uncertainty in terms of Hungarys risk perceptions. The Monetary Council welcomes the Governments commitment to next years deficit target which if met may contribute to reduced perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. The deteriorating outlook for activity points to disinflationary pressure from the demand side. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to boost the consumer price index temporarily. Although the weaker exchange rate and the planned increase in the minimum wage may generate shortterm inflationary pressures subdued inflationary pressures due to weak demand are likely to dominate developments in annual CPI inflation as the impact of cost shocks and the indirect tax increase gradually fades. However there is considerable uncertainty around the degree and time path of disinflation as developments in inflation have been affected by several shocks in the short term. The Monetary Council will therefore monitor particularly carefully the potential spillover impact of these shocks and developments in taxadjusted inflation in addition to the consumer price index. Monetary policy can best support the recovery and contribute to an environment conducive to investment and job creation by maintaining predictability and preserving the stability of prices and the financial system. The risks to the outlook for inflation and financial market developments warrant a waitandsee policy stance. The Monetary Council has therefore decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on November. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,82,2011
2011-11-29,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from November. In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to remain subdued over the next two years with the level of output remaining below its potential throughout the period. The consumer price index will increasingly reflect the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand after the effects of the indirect tax increases have worn off however the depreciation of the forint in recent months is a threat to meeting the per cent inflation target. Exchange rate depreciation is also increasing the vulnerability of the domestic financial system. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to raise the consumer price index significantly in. Fiscal compensation to companies will partly offset the effects of the minimum wage increase. The depreciation of the forint in recent months may lead to a buildup of inflationary pressure even in the medium term. The extent to which companies will be able to pass cost increases on to prices is a source of uncertainty in terms of the future outlook for inflation. The Monetary Council is closely monitoring developments in taxadjusted core inflation in addition to movements in the consumer price index. In the Councils judgement the outlook for Hungarian economic growth is unfavourable. The slowdown in global activity concerns about debt sustainability in some euroarea periphery countries and the vulnerability of the financial system point to a weak outlook in Hungarys export markets which in turn may dampen export growth. Consumption demand is likely to remain persistently low reflecting the protracted balance sheet adjustment by households uncertain income prospects the inflationary impact of indirect tax increases and the weaker exchange rate. Significant fiscal adjustment next year is also likely to act as a brake on domestic demand growth. Domestic lending continues to make little contribution to economic growth. Rolling over shortterm external funding has become more expensive and difficult for Hungarian banks due to the sovereign debt problems in the euroarea periphery. Furthermore the banking sectors capital position has been deteriorating due to losses arising from early repayments by households of foreign currencydenominated mortgages which in turn weakens banks lending capacity. Also the banking sectors willingness to lend is low. These factors may lead to a further tightening in credit supply as confirmed by the Banks latest lending survey. In the current uncertain economic environment the weaker outlook for growth and the tightening in credit conditions are acting as a drag on investment activity. Corporate profitability is expected to deteriorate. As a result corporate investment may fall significantly in which will be only partly offset by a couple of large individual investment projects in manufacturing. The depreciation of the forint and the increase in risk premia have continued over the past month. The deteriorating outlook for global growth the escalating euroarea sovereign debt crisis and growing tensions in the banking sector have been the main factors contributing to these unfavourable developments. All this leads to a deterioration in the outlook for growth in Hungary while creating more unfavourable financing conditions for the country. The adverse impact of the early repayment option for foreign currency borrowers on domestic banks capital position and increasing fiscal sustainability concerns also contributed to the increase in risk premia. The decision by the Government that it would conduct talks with the International Monetary Fund led to only temporary improvement in market sentiment which deteriorated again following the move by Moodys to downgrade Hungarys sovereign debt rating. In this situation the Monetary Council considers it important that an agreement between the Government and the international organisations as well as between the Government and the Banking Association is reached as soon as possible. Monetary policy can best support the recovery and contribute to an environment conducive to investment and job creation by maintaining predictability and preserving the stability of prices and the financial system. The depreciation of the forint in recent months has caused a deterioration in the inflation outlook and increased the need for balance sheet adjustment in the economy. The Monetary Council decided to raise the base rate by basis points in view of the upside risks to inflation and increased perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. If the outlook for inflation and risk perceptions remain persistently unfavourable it may prove necessary to raise interest rates further in the coming months. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,83,2011
2011-12-20,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from December. The Monetary Council also reviewed the December issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to be stagnant next year with growth expected to resume in. The level of output will remain below its potential over the entire forecast period. The consumer price index may increasingly reflect the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand as the effects of the indirect tax increases and the exchange rate depreciation wane. The outlook for inflation and growth and the recent increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy made it necessary to raise interest rates. Inflation can be brought back to by early by maintaining a tight monetary policy. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to raise the consumer price index significantly in. Fiscal compensation will cushion the effect of the minimum wage increase on companies labour costs and therefore it is unlikely to cause considerable inflationary pressure. However the depreciation of the forint in recent months reflecting the increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy has led to a deterioration in the inflation outlook. The Monetary Council is closely monitoring developments in taxadjusted core inflation in addition to movements in the consumer price index. In the Councils judgement the outlook for Hungarian economic growth is unfavourable. The slowdown in global growth contractionary fiscal policies aimed at preserving the sustainability of public debts in Europe and the vulnerability of the financial system point to a weak outlook for activity in Hungarys export markets which in turn may dampen export growth. The euroarea debt crisis has made it more expensive for Hungarian banks to roll over their external funding. In the current uncertain economic environment the weaker outlook for growth and tighter credit conditions are acting as a drag on investment activity. As a result corporate investment may fall in which will be only partly offset by a couple of large individual investment projects in manufacturing. The Monetary Council welcomes the agreement between the Government and the Banking Association which is likely to reduce the burden on foreign currency debtors and thereby strengthen bank lending activity. The process of balance sheet adjustment by households is likely to be protracted reflecting the effects of the weak exchange rate. Given the uncertain prospects for income growth and the indirect tax increases consumption is likely to remain persistently low. The Governments measures to ensure that the target for next years budget deficit is met are also likely to act as a significant brake on domestic demand growth but may help reduce perceptions of the risks associated with Hungary. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased recently due to the escalating euroarea sovereign debt crisis the increasing risks faced by the European banking sector the deteriorating outlook for global growth and domestic factors. Higher risk premia and increased financing risks are limiting the potential growth of the economy. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding the outlook for global and domestic growth and financial markets the Monetary Council considers it important that an agreement between the Government the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is reached as soon as possible in order to reduce financing risks. Monetary policy can best support the recovery by ensuring a predictable economic environment maintaining price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. The recent depreciation of the forint has led to a deterioration in the inflation outlook and increased the vulnerability of the domestic financial system. The Monetary Council decided to raise the base rate by basis points in view of increased perceptions of the risks associated with the economy and upside risks to inflation. If risk perceptions and the outlook for inflation deteriorate significantly further it may prove necessary to raise interest rates again. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on January. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,84,2011
2012-01-24,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely be stagnant next year with growth expected to resume only in. The level of output will remain below its potential over the entire forecast period. As the effects of the indirect tax increases and the exchange rate depreciation wane the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is likely to become the dominant factor shaping inflation.The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to lead to a significant increase in the price index in. Fiscal compensation will cushion the effect of the inflationary effect of the minimum wage increase on labour costs however the weaker exchange rate reflecting increased perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy is leading to a deterioration in the inflation outlook. In addition to the consumer price index the Monetary Council is also closely monitoring developments in taxadjusted core inflation which continues to indicate relatively modest inflationary pressures in the economy.The slowdown in global growth and the euroarea debt crisis point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungarys export markets which in turn may dampen export growth and contribute to a deterioration in the outlook for Hungarian economic growth. The escalation of the euroare debt crisis and the risks faced by the European banking sector have led to a tightening in domestic credit conditions. In the current uncertain economic environment the weaker outlook for growth and tighter credit conditions are restraining investment. Consumption is likely to remain persistently low reflecting the weaker exchange rate the uncertain prospects for income growth and the indirect tax increases. The Governments measures to ensure that the target for next years budget deficit is met are also likely to act as a significant brake on domestic demand growth but at the same time are necessary to improve Hungarys risk assessment.Recent events surrounding a loan agreement between the Government and the IMF have been the most important factor shaping perceptions about the economy for example the change in the Governments communication about its intention to submit a formal request for an IMF loan and statements by government officials in response to messages calling for changes to legislation found to be in conflict with EU law. Hungarys indicators continued to deteriorate as tensions between the Government and the IMF and EU increased. Subsequently after reaching its height during the particularly turbulent period of and January this negative trend reversed and began to improve with the Governments communication in favour of an agreement. The Governments increasing commitment to reach an agreement with the IMF and EU has resulted in an improvement in perceptions about the economy with this improvement in perceptions becoming dominant in recent days. However increased uncertainty and high market volatility have remained.Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. If necessary the Monetary Council is ready to use the instruments at its disposal to meet these objectives.In light of increased perceptions of risk and the upside risks to inflation the Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. If perceptions about the economy and the outlook for inflation deteriorate significantly further it may prove necessary to raise interest rates again.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February .The Councils assessment of performance in meeting the inflation target in Annual average inflation was in down on the previous year. During most of the year inflation fluctuated near the upper bound of the + tolerance band around the Banks inflation target.Unprocessed food and oil price shocks starting at the end of were the most important factors contributing to inflation remaining above the target in H. Persistent rises in world food prices fed through into domestic processed food prices and domestic fuel prices began to reflect higher global oil prices. As a result of these effects the consumer price index hovered near in H. The secondround effects of the cost shocks had only a modest impact on the consumer price index due to the downward effects on prices and wages of weak domestic demand and loose labour market conditions.Although the consumer price index fell in H as the inflationary impact of the cost shocks waned and domestic demand remained weak the increases in indirect taxes again led to a pickup in inflation. The increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy beginning in late summer resulted in a sharp depreciation of the forint exchange rate which in turn contributed directly to increases in the prices of imported goods. However due to weak domestic demand firms were able to increase prices of many products only to a limited extent. As a result the inflationary effect of the much weaker exchange rate was modest overall.In the long term monetary policy can best contribute to the predictability of the economic environment and economic growth by maintaining price stability and ensuring the stability of the financial system. The indicators of the longerterm inflationary outlook showed moderate inflationary pressures throughout the year. Under the monetary conditions maintained in and with domestic demand remaining persistently weak the risk of inflationary shocks leading to longerterm secondround effects is low. The Monetary Council will continue its efforts to ensure that the consumer price index is consistent with the inflation target in the medium term.MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,85,2012
2012-02-28,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up perceptibly in. The level of output will remain below its potential this year and next. The consumer price index is expected to rise significantly reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of. However low inflation dynamics due to weak domestic demand will be the main determinant of consumer prices as the effects of the indirect tax increases wane.In January consumer prices rose more strongly than expected due in part to the sharp increase in fuel prices and higher underlying inflation. Interpreting the January data is surrounded by greaterthanusual uncertainty due to the indirect tax changes however uncertainty may decrease as new data become available over the next few months. In addition to the consumer price index the Monetary Council is also closely monitoring developments in taxadjusted core inflation which also rose in January.The slowdown in global growth and the euroarea debt crisis point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungarys export markets which in turn will contribute to a deterioration in the outlook for Hungarian economic growth. It is difficult to judge whether the betterthanexpected preliminary GDP release for Q reflects a lasting trend. While exports contributed to growth during the final months of the year domestic demand is likely to have remained subdued in Q.Looking forward the uncertain global and domestic environment and the tightening in credit conditions will restrain investment activity. Consumption is likely to remain low due to the uncertain prospects for income growth and tight fiscal policy. However Government measures aimed to ensure that the deficit target is met are required for perceptions about Hungary to improve.There has been an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy in the past month as reflected in the appreciation of the forint exchange rate and the decline in risk indicators. This has been driven by favourable global developments although countryspecific factors related to expectations about an agreement with the IMF and EU have also pointed to an improvement. Risk perceptions have been highly volatile over the past few months. For this reason the Monetary Council continues to consider it important that an agreement between the Government the EU and the IMF is reached as soon as possible in order to reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt.The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. High volatility of financial markets over the recent period continues to warrant a cautious policy stance.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,86,2012
2012-03-27,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .The Council also reviewed the March issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff.In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to stagnate this year with growth expected to resume in. The level of output will remain below its potential over the entire period. The consumer price index is expected to rise significantly reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of. In the longer term however the path of consumer prices is likely to be dominated by the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand.Consumer prices rose more sharply in the first few months of the year than projected in the December Report. In part that may have reflected the rapid passthrough of increases in indirect taxes and higher underlying inflation. Despite weak domestic demand firms with declining profitability may be able to pass on some of the increase in their costs due to the weaker exchange rate and rising commodity prices as suggested by the rises in taxadjusted core inflation in JanuaryFebruary. In the Councils judgement however the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is likely to be a key determinant of consumer prices as the effects of the indirect tax increases and the depreciation of the exchange rate wane. Nevertheless special attention should be given to the inflationary effects of rising oil prices.The slowdown in global growth and the euroarea debt crisis point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungarys export markets. Moreover balance sheet adjustment by the European banking sector continues. In the current global environment export growth is likely to weaken and tight credit conditions to remain. However Hungarys export markets and the rate of export growth may recover gradually from mid. Domestic demand is expected to decline further. The uncertain global and domestic economic environment and the tightening in credit conditions will restrain investment growth. Household consumption is likely to remain low due to the uncertain prospects for income growth and tight fiscal policy. However Government measures aimed to ensure that the deficit target is met are required for perceptions about the Hungarian economy to improve. Labour market conditions are expected to be loose over the period ahead as the increase in activity is likely to be associated with subdued demand for labour.Perceptions about the Hungarian economy have changed little in the past month despite the increase in global risk appetite. Global financial markets have been highly volatile over the past six months. The Monetary Council therefore continues to consider it important that an agreement between the Government the EU and IMF is reached as soon as possible in order to reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt. The Council noted the important structural measures taken by the Government to reduce the budget deficit.The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. High volatility of risk perceptions and underlying inflation continue to warrant a cautious policy stance.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,87,2012
2012-04-24,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to stagnate this year with growth expected to resume in. The level of output will remain below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to rise significantly reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties in and as well as the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of and the rise in oil prices in early. The latest Government measures announced as part of the Structural Reform Programme are likely to result in an increase in inflation in while causing aggregate demand to contract which in turn may reduce the risk of secondround effects on inflation.The inflation data released over the past month was broadly in line with the projection in the March Quarterly Report for Inflation. The rate of increase of consumer prices slowed in March relative to levels experienced in previous months as reflected in a decline in measures of underlying inflation. Recent real economy data confirmed that domestic industrial production growth stalled in early reflecting weak external demand conditions. That in turn may set back the recovery in the economy. The Council expects that activity in Hungarys export markets will pick up gradually from mid which is likely to affect growth in exports. By contrast domestic demand is expected to fall further in the coming quarters. Uncertainty surrounding the prospects for income growth and the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation on aggregate demand continue to point to weak growth in investment and household consumption.Government measures aimed to ensure that the deficit target is met are required for perceptions about Hungary to improve. One of the key challenges facing the economy is ensuring the sustainability of government debt which requires that the countrys ability to attract capital and its longterm growth potential be improved. The structure of measures taken to meet the government deficit target is vitally important in this regard. In the Councils view it is important that the new taxes announced by the Government are introduced in a way which minimises their distorting effects on the economy.Perceptions about the Hungarian economy have deteriorated in the past month mainly driven by global factors including problems with the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euroarea countries. Over the past few quarters risk premia demanded by investors for holding Hungarian assets have remained stuck at high levels relative to the performance of the economy which affects negatively the countrys ability to finance its debt. The Council therefore continues to consider it important that an agreement between the Government and the EU and IMF on the provision of a financial safety net for Hungary be reached as soon as possible. Such an agreement would reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt and slow the pace of withdrawals of foreign funding from the domestic banking sector being one of the most important obstacles to economic recovery.The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. High volatility of risk perceptions and recent trends in underlying inflation continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Council will take all efforts to ensure that the measures announced by the Government do not contribute to mediumterm inflationary pressure and inflation returns to levels consistent with the Banks mediumterm inflation target as the direct effects of the measures dissipate. In addition the Council will give special attention to the impact of the Structural Reform Programme on perceptions of risks.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,88,2012
2012-05-29,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .In the Councils judgement the nearterm prospects of the Hungarian economy are weak with growth only expected to resume in. The level of output will remain below its potential in the period ahead. Despite subdued domestic demand and the degree of slack in the labour market the consumer price index is expected to remain elevated over the next few quarters reflecting the effects of the tax changes and cost shocks.Domestic inflation is likely to rise significantly driven by increases in VAT and excise duties last year and this year as well as by the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of and the rise in oil prices in early. The government measures announced as part of the Structural Reform Programme are expected to directly raise inflation in while causing aggregate demand to contract thereby reducing the risk of secondround effects on inflation. However the development of secondround effects cannot be ruled out due to persistently abovetarget inflation and therefore the Council must monitor closely developments in underlying inflation and earnings.The significantly weakerthanexpected preliminary firstquarter GDP data may have reflected in part temporary factors affecting some sectors of the economy and the fasterthananticipated weakening in recent economic performance. The sharp deterioration in the external environment weakens the shortterm outlook for exports. Although there is uncertainty about the expected recovery in Hungarys export markets from the middle of the year the pickup in production following the buildup of manufacturing capacities over the past quarters may boost export growth. But domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. The uncertain prospects for income growth continued deleveraging by banks tight credit conditions and the contractionary effects of fiscal measures on aggregate demand continue to point to subdued investment and household consumption over the period ahead.As a result of the improvement in countryspecific factors and the deterioration in global factors perceptions of the risks associated with the economy have been volatile in the past month. Risk premia demanded by investors for holding Hungarian assets remain high. An escalation of concerns over the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euroarea countries may adversely affect premia on Hungarian financial assets. The Council therefore continues to consider it highly important that an agreement between the Government and the EU and IMF is reached as soon as possible.Meeting the Governments deficit target is essential to achieving an improvement in perceptions about the Hungarian economy. One of the key challenges facing the economy is ensuring the sustainability of government debt which requires that the countrys ability to attract capital and its longterm growth potential be improved. The structure of measures taken to meet the government deficit target is vitally important in this regard.The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged in light of the above considerations. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system.The volatile risk environment and inflation running above target for an extended period continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Monetary Council will make every effort to ensure that the measures announced by the Government do not contribute to mediumterm inflationary pressure and inflation returns to levels consistent with the Banks mediumterm inflation target as the direct effects of the measures wear off.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,89,2012
2012-06-26,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .The Monetary Council reviewed the June issue of the MNBs Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff.In the Councils judgement output is likely to fall this year with growth only expected to resume in. The level of output will remain below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to remain above the inflation target for a protracted period reflecting the effects of the tax changes and other administrative measures.Although inflationary pressures from the real economy remain moderate the increases in VAT and excise duties in early as well as the measures announced as part of the Structural Reform Programme continue to keep inflation above target. The tax measures directly affecting consumer prices are likely to raise inflation only temporarily. By contrast the measures leading to increases in production costs for companies are expected to feed through to inflation gradually and therefore may influence inflation over a longer horizon. But this indirect effect will be offset by falling domestic demand and slack in the labour market. Consequently the price index is expected to fall back close to the target as the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the cost shocks wear off.The significantly weakerthanexpected firstquarter GDP data partly reflected transient factors however the outlook for economic growth has also deteriorated over the entire forecast period. The sharp slowdown in external demand weakens the outlook for domestic exports and the recovery in Hungarys export markets expected from the end of this year is surrounded by significant risks. However the pickup in production following the buildup of manufacturing capacities over the past quarters may mitigate the effect of the slowdown in external demand. Domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. Persistently high unemployment falling real incomes and the uncertain prospects for income growth point to declining household consumption over the period ahead. Investment is likely to remain subdued reflecting the weak outlook for economic activity the unpredictable business environment and tight credit conditions. The Governments measures to reduce the deficit are likely to lead to a further contraction in domestic demand.Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have been volatile recently. Growing concerns over the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euroarea countries may adversely affect premia on Hungarian financial assets. The Council therefore continues to consider it highly important that an agreement between the Government and the EU and IMF is reached as soon as possible.The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged in light of the above considerations. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system.The volatile risk environment and abovetarget inflation for an extended period continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Council will make every effort to ensure that the upward impact on prices of the measures announced by the Government does not have any secondround consequences and inflation returns to levels consistent with the mediumterm target as the direct effect of the measures wears off. The Council will consider a reduction in interest rates if Hungarys risk premium falls persistently and substantially and the outlook for inflation improves.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,90,2012
2012-07-24,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .In the Councils judgement economic output is likely to fall this year with growth only expected to resume in. The level of output will be below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon reflecting the effects of tax changes and other administrative measures.CPI inflation in June was higher than previously expected. Measures capturing underlying inflation developments remained at low levels with transient factors related to a couple of items probably contributing to the pickup in inflation in the month. Inflationary pressures from the real economy continue to be subdued due to weakening demand but the tax increases in early the measures included in the Structural Reform Programme and the latest announcement of an increase in excise duties are likely to cause inflation to exceed the target over a sustained period. The consumer price index is expected to remain significantly above the mediumterm target into as a result of a series of increases in indirect taxes affecting consumer prices. Although this is unlikely to fuel secondround effects due to persistently weak demand and slack in the labour market meeting the inflation target is expected to be delayed.Hungarian export growth is weighed down by the slowing in external demand and moreover there is significant uncertainty around the recovery in Hungarys export markets expected from the second half of this year. However the pickup in production following the buildup of manufacturing capacities over the past quarters may offset the effects of the slowdown in external demand. Domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. Persistently high unemployment falling real incomes and precautionary behaviour by households suggest that consumption will decline over the period ahead. Investment is likely to remain subdued reflecting the weak outlook for economic activity the unpredictable business environment and tight credit conditions.Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have improved recently but financial markets remain fragile. Growing risks related to the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euroarea countries may negatively affect premia on Hungarian financial assets however stabilisation of fiscal positions in euroarea countries may contribute to an improvement in perceptions about Hungary. The Monetary Council welcomes the start of negotiations between the Government and the EU and IMF. Reaching an agreement in the current volatile environment could lead to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions. It is very important in terms of the future evolution of the risk premium that the Government remain committed to meeting the fiscal deficit target.The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged in light of the above considerations. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. The Council will make every effort to ensure that the upward impact on prices of the measures announced by the Government does not have any secondround consequences and inflation returns to levels consistent with the mediumterm target as the direct effects of the measures wear off.The volatile risk environment and abovetarget inflation for an extended period continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Council will consider a reduction in interest rates if Hungarys risk premium falls persistently and substantially and the outlook for inflation improves.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,91,2012
2012-08-28,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from August. In the Councils judgement economic output is likely to fall this year with growth only expected to resume in. The level of output will be below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon reflecting the effects of tax changes administrative measures and the increase in commodity prices. CPI inflation in June and July was higher than previously expected as a result of higher unprocessed food prices and the increase in excise duties in the course of the year. Inflationary pressures from the real economy continue to be subdued due to weakening domestic demand but the tax increases in early the measures included in the Structural Reform Programme and the latest announcement of an increase in excise duties are likely to cause inflation to exceed the target over a sustained period. Higherthanexpected global oil prices and the unfolding food price shock represent upside risks to inflation. The latter has been reflected in developments in unprocessed food prices in recent months. The consumer price index is expected to remain significantly above the mediumterm target into as a result of a series of increases in indirect taxes affecting consumer prices. Although the risk of secondround effects is low due to persistently weak demand and slack in the labour market meeting the inflation target is expected to be delayed. Secondquarter GDP data reflect a weakening in general economic activity. The contraction in output in the quarter implies that the economy is technically in recession. The sharp slowdown in external demand is pulling down on the outlook for Hungarian exports. The decline in industrial production continued despite steady growth in capacity in the automobile industry. Falls in the construction sector agriculture and retail trade outweighed the rise in vehicle production. Domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. Investment will remain subdued reflecting the weak outlook for economic activity the unpredictable business environment and tight credit conditions. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have fallen further recently however that improvement has been driven mostly by external factors. Positive international investor sentiment reflected announcements related to euroarea crisis management but decision and implementation risks associated with measures designed to address problems related to sovereign debt sustainability within the euro area remained. The Governments commitment to maintaining a sound fiscal policy and to reaching an agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is crucial in terms of the future evolution of the risk premium. The Monetary Council has decided to reduce the base rate in light of the above considerations. The Council will continue to closely monitor underlying inflation developments. Monetary policy can only be eased to the extent that supply shocks to the economy and the upward impact on prices of the Governments measures do not lead to the buildup of secondround inflationary effects and perceptions about the Hungarian economy continue to improve. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,92,2012
2012-09-25,Factors pointing in the direction of an easing and a tightening of monetary policy have been present simultaneously since the outset of the financial crisis. The sharp decline in and persistent weakness of domestic demand would warrant a reduction in interest rates. However continued cost shocks to the price level prevented any sustained fall in inflation and therefore a cautious approach to interest rate policy was warranted. The global financial market environment and unfavourable movements in domestic asset prices also limited the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy from time to time. According to the Councils assessment in June the factors pointing to an increase or a reduction in interest rates offset each other. In its June press release the Council had indicated that a cautious approach to monetary policy was warranted by the risk environment and inflation remaining persistently above target and that interest rates could only be reduced after upside risks to inflation subsided. There has been a sharp deterioration in the outlook for both inflation and the economy over the past quarter. But the global financial market environment improved and as a result perceptions of the risks associated with Hungarian financial assets fell markedly. Considering these factors the Council in August voted to reduce the policy rate by basis points after maintaining it in July. In its August press release the Council had indicated that monetary policy could only be eased to the extent that supply shocks to the economy and the upward impact on prices of the Governments measures did not lead to the buildup of secondround inflationary effects. Economic developments Financial market sentiment has improved and the outlook for economic activity deteriorated around the world over the past quarter. Sentiment in international financial markets improved considerably in the summer months. Positive international investor sentiment mainly reflected announcements related to euroarea crisis management but expectations about a new round of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve also contributed to an increase in risk appetite. Despite the signs of improvement in financial markets however business survey indicators point to a further slowdown in most economic regions of the world and there is a risk that the euroarea economy will fall back into recession this year. In the Monetary Councils judgement the actions taken by euroarea governments will live up to expectations over time and economic activity in Europe will pick up gradually from. The contrast between improved perceptions of risks and very subdued economic activity has been reflected in domestic economic developments recently. In the favourable international environment premia on Hungarian financial assets fell markedly. However the contraction in economic output continued in the second quarter although less sharply than in the previous period. The decline in GDP reflected the effects of both external and domestic factors. Actions to reduce private and public debt accumulated during the precrisis period tight lending conditions and the uncertain economic environment continue to act as a significant drag on domestic demand. Production picked up as the large investment projects in the automotive industry were completed but the slowdown in Hungarys external markets offset some of the expansionary effect of new capacities on exports. The extremely poor harvest results in agriculture are likely to cause a further deterioration in the outlook for growth this year. In the Monetary Councils judgement the outlook for domestic economic growth has deteriorated recently and output is expected to grow only slowly in. Exports will remain the main driving force behind growth supported by the expected recovery in activity in Europe. Domestic demand will remain persistently weak reflecting falling real incomes continued balance sheet adjustment and tight lending conditions. Consumption and investment are likely to continue to decline next year. As a result of persistently high unemployment and low investment activity the potential growth of the economy is likely to remain weak next year. Labour market activity has strengthened recently reflecting the effects of measures taken by the Government over the past few years. However corporate demand for labour remained low as economic activity continued to weaken with the Governments public work programmes being the only source of growth in employment. Earnings growth has picked up sharply this year after being subdued in previous years. The administrative wage increases at the beginning of the year were an important factor contributing to the pickup in earnings growth however the wage inflation indicators rose even after excluding the effect of the minimum wage increase. The introduction of the wage compensation scheme for companies has temporarily reduced upward pressure on costs from strong earnings growth however rising unit labour costs associated with deteriorating sales opportunities have led to costpush inflationary pressures and restrained employment growth particularly in sectors producing for the domestic market. The Monetary Council will closely monitor developments in the factors driving the recent sharp increase in earnings growth. The Monetary Councils view is that the increase in unemployment during the crisis reflected in part permanent structural problems however even taking this factor into account slack in the labour market is likely to remain in the period ahead. With the outlook for economic activity remaining weak growth in demand for labour is expected to be slow. Therefore nominal earnings growth may moderate as the effects of the minimum wage increase wear off. The job protection action plan to be implemented next year is likely to result in a reduction in the employment costs of employees affected by the programme. In the Monetary Councils judgement the measures will be sufficient only to cushion the effects of weak activity and private sector employment is likely to grow at a subdued pace at best. As the outlook for growth deteriorated the annual consumer price index remained persistently close to the levels seen at the beginning of the year. High inflation reflects in part the effects of the increase in indirect taxes by the Government and the unfolding food price shock. Other measures of inflation which exclude these effects and capture underlying inflation developments also rose with the passthrough of cost shocks into prices being greater than previously expected. Looking ahead the unfolding food price shock and new government measures are likely to cause the consumer price index to remain at an elevated level through higher excise duties and rises in companies production costs. Rising labour costs increases in taxes on production and higher commodity prices as well as the downward impact of weak demand on prices all play a role in shaping developments in underlying inflation. In aggregate inflation i.e. the annual rate of increase of consumer prices is expected to remain significantly above the per cent target for most of the forecast period with the target only likely to be met in the second half of. In the Monetary Councils view Hungarys external financing capacity may continue to increase in the coming years. The improvement in the countrys external balance reflects rising EU transfers in addition to the continuous increase in the surplus on the balance of goods and services however the deficit on the income account has been increasing. The investment projects in the automotive industry brought into production will make a significant contribution to growth in net exports while weak demand will contribute to the high goods surplus through lower imports. While meeting the deficit target fiscal policy is likely to bear down on domestic demand this year and next. Although the measures announced as part of the job protection programme have led to a significant amount of fiscal easing in the government balance the Monetary Council assumes that the Government will remain committed to meeting the deficit targets and therefore expects fiscal adjustment to continue. The measures included in the technical assumptions of the projection are likely to raise the consumer price index in while restraining demand however they are necessary to achieve a gradual reduction in Hungarys risk premia. A sustainable decline in the fiscal deficit is key to the further reduction in government debt. The Monetary Council continues to consider it crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is reached as soon as possible in order to reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt and ensure that risk premia fall. Monetary policy considerations The outlook for the economy and consequently the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy are surrounded by a significant degree of uncertainty. The Councils monetary policy actions are influenced mainly by the future outlook for inflation the position of the economy in the current cycle and by perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. In the Councils assessment the economys production capacities may have been damaged and the rate of potential economic growth fell significantly as the crisis dragged on. Even as growth remained weak the output gap closed gradually during the crisis. There is uncertainty in the Monetary Council about the extent to which existing spare capacity in the economy is able to restrain increases in labour costs and prices. Developments in underlying inflation and rises in wages suggest that the disinflationary impact of subdued demand may have weakened recently. However a number of factors contributed to increases in wages and inflation and therefore it is difficult to distinguish demandpull effects form costpush effects. Consequently the role of permanent and cyclical factors in the economic downturn can be determined only with a considerable degree of uncertainty. If supply capacity is damaged to a smaller extent then the disinflationary impact of weak economic activity is greater and the inflation target can be met by maintaining looser monetary conditions. Another important question in terms of monetary policy decisions is the extent to which continued cost shocks to the economy alter economic agents inflation expectations. If agents expect inflation to remain persistently higher then the secondround effects of the cost shock may be stronger nominal wages may increase and underlying inflation may rise. In that case tighter monetary conditions are necessary to offset unfavourable developments. Changes in the financial market environment may also have a significant influence on monetary policy decisions. In terms of future developments in risk perceptions the Monetary Council judges that there is a chance of both an improvement and a deterioration in the current situation. Greaterthanexpected success in European crisis management and domestic economic policy measures to mitigate the risks to debt financing may help reduce risk premia. However a failure or significant delay in reaching an agreement between Government and the European Commission and the IMF may lead to a sharp rise in risk premia. A majority of Monetary Councils members judge that there continues to be a significant margin of spare capacity in the economy. Therefore weak domestic demand dampens the direct inflationary impact of cost shocks. The inflation target is likely to be met as the direct effects of cost shocks wear off. The measures to address the European sovereign debt crisis will contribute significantly to the improvement in the global financial market environment which in turn will result in a sustained fall in domestic risk premia. Overall expected developments in inflation and financial markets as well as persistently weak demand warrant an easing of current monetary conditions. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates if the improvement in financial market sentiment persists and mediumterm upside risks to inflation remain moderate.,93,2012
2012-10-30,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from October. In the Monetary Councils judgement economic output is likely to fall this year with growth only expected to resume in. The level of output will be below its potential and unemployment will remain above its longterm level determined by structural factors in the period ahead. Weak demand conditions are expected to persist and the inflation target can be met in after the temporary inflationary impact of shocks to inflation wanes. Inflation picked up in September mainly reflecting rises in food and fuel prices. The consumer price index remains high due mainly to increases in raw material prices as well as the effects of tax changes and administrative measures. Inflation is likely to stay significantly above the mediumterm target this year and next however the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is expected to increasingly dominate inflation developments as the upward pressure from oneoff price level shocks fades. The Council expects the per cent inflation target to be met in. In order to reach a higher level of employment and mitigate cost pressures on companies it is crucial that increases in wages next year particularly in the minimum wage are consistent with changes in wholeeconomy productivity. The Hungarian economy has fallen into recession and growth is likely to resume next year as the countrys export markets recover. The latest economic data appear to confirm that domestic demand has remained subdued and external economic activity has weakened further. In the Monetary Councils judgement output will remain persistently below its potential level and the labour market will remain loose. The weakness of corporate investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the economys potential growth rate is significantly below its precrisis level. The measures announced in recent weeks confirmed the Governments commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit path. There is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of the adjustment measures the shortterm outlook for growth and inflation is likely to be broadly unaffected but cost pressures may arise in the medium term and the potential growth rate of the economy may fall reflecting the reduced ability of the banking system to attract capital and restrained lending activity. The December issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation will contain the Monetary Councils detailed assessment of the effects of fiscal measures on inflation and the real economy. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy have fallen significantly with countryspecific factors and regulatory changes both contributing to the positive developments in Hungarys risk indicators. Consistent with its earlier view the Monetary Council considers it crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund is reached as this would contribute to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions and a decline in yields as well as to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and improve the investment climate. The Monetary Council judges that there remains a substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy. Therefore the cost shocks hitting the economy have no adverse effect on the mediumterm outlook for inflation and the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand will dominate as the effects of cost shocks wane. The improving global financial market environment coupled with the Governments strong commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit may contribute to a sustained decline in risk premia on domestic financial assets. Expected developments in inflation and financial markets as well as persistently weak demand warrant a lower interest rate level. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates if data becoming available in the coming months confirm that the improvement in financial market sentiment persists and the mediumterm outlook for inflation remains consistent with the per cent target. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on November. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,94,2012
2012-11-27,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from November. In the Monetary Councils judgement economic output is likely to fall this year with growth only expected to resume in. The level of output will be below its potential and unemployment will remain above its longterm level determined by structural factors. Weak demand conditions are expected to persist and the inflation target can be met in as the temporary inflationary impact of shocks to inflation wanes. The slowdown in CPI inflation in October mainly reflected the fall in fuel prices and the moderation in administered price inflation. The shortterm outlook for inflation improved mostly as a result of favourable developments in noncore inflation items. A sustained reduction in risk premia may lead to an improvement in the mediumterm outlook for inflation as well while the Governments costraising measures may point in the opposite direction. The consumer price index remains high due primarily to rises in food prices as well as the effects of tax increases and other administrative measures. Inflation is likely to remain well above the target this year and next however the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is expected to increasingly dominate inflation developments as the upward pressure from oneoff price level shocks subsides. The Council expects the per cent inflation target to be met in. In order to reduce cost pressures on companies and reach a higher level of employment it is crucial that increases in wages next year particularly in the minimum wage are consistent with changes in wholeeconomy productivity. The Hungarian economy remains in recession and growth is likely to resume next year as the countrys export markets recover. Both external and domestic factors point to weak growth over the period ahead. In the Councils judgement output will remain persistently below its potential level and the labour market will remain loose. The weakness of corporate investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the economys potential growth rate is significantly below its precrisis level. The measures announced by the Government confirmed its commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit path. There is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of the adjustment measures the shortterm outlook for growth and inflation is likely to be broadly unaffected but cost pressures may arise in the medium term and the potential growth rate of the economy may fall reflecting the reduced ability of the banking system to attract capital and restrained lending activity. Higher risks around the agreement with the multinational organisations and the downgrade of Hungarys sovereign debt by SP may lead to an increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. The Council continues to consider it crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund is reached as this would contribute to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions and a decline in yields as well as to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and improve the investment climate. The Council judges that there remains a substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy. Therefore the cost shocks hitting the economy have no adverse effect on the mediumterm outlook for inflation and the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand will dominate as the impact of cost shocks wanes. The favourable global financial market environment coupled with the Governments strong commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit may contribute to a sustained decline in risk premia on domestic financial assets. Expected developments in inflation and financial markets as well as persistently weak demand warrant a lower interest rate level. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates if the improvement in financial market sentiment continues and the mediumterm outlook for inflation is consistent with the per cent target.

2012-12-18,Monetary policy over the past quarter In the period from September to November the Monetary Council reduced the central bank base rate in three successive steps by a total of basis points. The Councils decisions reflected the view that looking forward weak domestic demand would have a substantial disinflationary impact on the economy which would increasingly dominate inflation developments as the cost shocks keeping inflation high in the short term dissipated thereby helping to meet the Banks inflation target. Global risk appetite increased significantly during this period contributing to a marked decline in Hungarian risk premia and opening up additional room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In its November press release the Monetary Council indicated that it would consider a further reduction in interest rates if the improvement in financial market sentiment continued and the mediumterm outlook for inflation was consistent with the Banks per cent target. Macroeconomic developments and outlook Over the past quarter the international environment was marked by strongly divergent trends. Financial market sentiment improved while the euroarea economy fell back into recession this year and the outlook for global activity deteriorated. Official announcements on the ongoing crisis management efforts in Europe and further quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve both contributed to the increase in investor risk appetite. The Monetary Council expects that the measures taken by European countries to help manage the crisis in the euro area will live up to the expectations and that activity on the Continent will recover gradually over the next two years. Turning to developments in the domestic economy there has also been a contrast between improving perceptions of risk and subdued real activity. Output continued to fall in the second and third quarters though less so than in the first quarter. Domestic and external factors both contributed to the decline in GDP. While the slowdown in external markets continues to hinder Hungarian export growth actions to reduce private and public debts accumulated in the period prior to the financial crisis tight credit conditions and the uncertain business environment act as a persistent drag on domestic demand. Meanwhile risk premia on Hungarian assets fell sharply amid signs of increasing global risk appetite. In the Monetary Councils judgement the outlook for economic growth has deteriorated recently and output is likely to grow only modestly over the next two years. Exports are expected to remain the primary source of growth even as external demand continues to soften while domestic demand will remain weak. Domestic balancesheet deleveraging will continue with consumption and investment likely to fall further mainly due to tight credit conditions and the uncertain business environment followed by a gradual recovery from. The potential output of the Hungarian economy is likely to increase very modestly over the next two years reflecting the sustained weakness in investment and persistently high unemployment. Labour market activity has strengthened gradually in recent years but companies have limited ability to absorb the excess supply of labour from the market in a weak demand environment. The rate of earnings growth has picked up sharply this year with the administrative measures at the start of the year playing a major role. The introduction of the wage compensation scheme for companies cushioned the upward impact of high earnings growth on costs. Nevertheless unit labour costs increased leading to a deterioration in corporate profitability. In the Councils judgement the rise in unemployment in recent years partly reflects permanent structural problems but the labour market is likely to remain loose in the period ahead even taking account of this factor. In addition to the weak outlook for growth and companies poor profitability the increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage for skilled workers are also impeding a recovery in employment which is only likely to start in the private sector in. Although the job protection scheme to be launched next year is expected to lower the costs of employing labour under the programme the Governments measures which result in a deterioration in private sector profitability suggest that companies will continue to adjust going forward. The consumer price index has remained persistently above the inflation target this year despite the recessionary environment. The high rate of inflation mainly reflects the effects of the commodity price shocks and the Governments indirect tax increases while the pace of underlying inflation remains moderate. Looking ahead inflation is expected to slow significantly in the short term mainly reflecting movements in items excluded from the core measure. In the medium term however the burden placed on companies by the administrative measures and the minimum wage increase will strengthen the passthrough of higher costs to prices which in turn may generate costpush inflationary pressure along the entire production chain. In terms of the outlook for inflation there is significant uncertainty about the extent and timing of the passthrough of higher corporate costs to prices in the wake of those measures and the ability of weak domestic demand to offset this. In the Monetary Councils judgement Hungarys net external financing capacity is likely to rise further in the coming years. This improvement in the economys external position will reflect the steady increase in the surplus on goods and services and higher inflows of EU transfers. However the negative income balance is likely to deteriorate further. In and the fiscal deficit is expected to be broadly consistent with the Governments target. The measures announced in recent months are likely to lead to a significant improvement in the fiscal balance in. There is considerable uncertainty about the expected size of deficit in. The Governments commitment to maintaining a low fiscal deficit path may contribute to longterm fiscal sustainability but the slowdown in potential growth may have the opposite effect. Maintaining its earlier position the Council continues to consider it crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund be reached as this would contribute to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions and a decline in yields as well as to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and improve the investment climate. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by a considerable degree of uncertainty. With a negative output gap and inflation remaining at high levels the latest government measures will raise companies production costs. One key issue in terms of the mediumterm inflation outlook relevant for monetary policy is the ability of the corporate sector to adjust to the increase in production costs against the backdrop of a weaker outlook for growth. The sustained decline in profitability may prompt companies to cut back further on investment expenditure which in turn may lead to a slowdown in potential output growth. In the short run given the amount of capital available to them companies may choose to restore profitability by improving productivity and reducing wage costs. Furthermore they may attempt to pass on increased costs into prices which in turn may imply higher consumer prices. The relative strength of these adjustment channels depends on the extent to which the availability of unused capacity is able to exert discipline on price and wagesetting and inflation expectations are wellanchored. The aim of monetary policy is to ensure that this adjustment takes place against the background of moderate wage and price dynamics in order to make it possible to meet the per cent inflation target in the medium term. The Monetary Council will closely monitor developments in taxadjusted inflation. In the Monetary Councils judgement the potential growth rate of the Hungarian economy has fallen significantly recently reflecting the postponement of investment decisions and financing constraints on companies there is however considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the reduction in productive capacity available to businesses. If the supply side of the economy has been damaged only to a smaller extent companies will have less room to pass on increased costs into prices due to the stronger disinflationary impact of unused capacities. All this may result in more moderate inflation in the medium term which is more consistent with a looser monetary policy. By contrast if companies expect the high inflation environment of recent years to persist the passing on of cost pressures to prices may be stronger. At the same time economic agents higher inflation expectations may also affect wagesetting in addition to pricesetting decisions which in turn would impede the recovery in profitability in the medium term and would merely lead to a higher nominal path. Corporate adjustment through higher price and wage dynamics can be prevented by tightening monetary policy. The room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is materially influenced by perceptions of the risks associated with the economy which have fallen significantly in recent months mainly reflecting global factors. Looking ahead the Council judges that there are both upside and downside risks to changes in risk perceptions. The contrast between weak global economic activity and strong risk appetite in international financial markets warrants a cautious monetary policy stance. At the same time progress with the institutional reforms in the euro area the reduction in fiscal risks in the US as well as expectations related to the success of domestic fiscal consolidation may increase the room for interest rate policy manoeuvre in Hungary. In the Councils assessment the high level of excess capacity in the economy offsets mediumterm inflationary risks. This is supported by the fact that underlying inflation remains moderate and inflation is kept high by transient factors. In the weak demand environment the corporate sector can adjust to the upward effects of the Government measures on costs only through moderate price increases. Given the slack conditions in the labour market the rate of earnings growth is likely to slow as the effects of administrative measures fade. Taking these factors into account the inflation target can be met even if monetary conditions are eased. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates only if the improvement in financial market sentiment continues and incoming data confirm that the inflation target is achievable on the horizon relevant for monetary policy.,96,2012
2013-01-29,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from January .In the Monetary Councils judgement economic growth is likely to resume this year following last years recession. The level of output will be below its potential and unemployment will remain above its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist which will ensure that inflation returns to rates close to the inflation target as the impact of temporary shocks wanes.Inflation slowed in December with declines in the prices of durable goods processed foods and fuels being the major contributing factors. The moderate pace of underlying inflation reflects the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. There has recently been a significant improvement in the shortterm outlook for inflation due mainly to the government measures affecting the prices of noncore items. However if companies pass on higher production costs into prices in response to the government measures it may pose an upside risk to the mediumterm outlook for inflation. The Monetary Council will therefore continue to monitor closely developments in underlying inflation.Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume following last years recession as the countrys export markets recover however both external and domestic demand factors point to only modest growth over the period ahead. The Council judges that there remains a degree of spare capacity in the economy output continues to be significantly below its potential level and the labour market remains loose. At the same time the weakness in investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the potential growth rate of the economy is significantly below its precrisis level.The improvement in global risk appetite has continued over the past month but the contrast between buoyant sentiment in international financial markets and the subdued outlook for global growth continues to pose a risk. Meanwhile domestic risk premia have not moved significantly in either direction. In the Councils judgement it remains crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund is reached as this would contribute to further falls in risk premia and yields which in turn would contribute to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and enhance the predictability of the investment environment.The Monetary Council emphasises that the monetary policy instruments currently available allow enough room for manoeuvre to maintain a monetary policy stance consistent with the current outlook for inflation and the real economy and that under domestic circumstances expanding the range of unconventional policy tools may provide effective support only during times of acute financial market stress.The Council judges that there remains a substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy. Once the effects of last years cost shocks wane the disinflationary impact of weak demand conditions is expected to dominate therefore companies will have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. The inflation target can be met on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. The improved global financial market environment and the Governments commitment to maintaining a low fiscal deficit path may contribute to a sustained decline in risk premia on domestic assets. These factors warranted and allowed a further cautious easing of monetary conditions. The Council will only consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the mediumterm outlook for inflation remains consistent with the Banks target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February .The Councils assessment of performance in meeting the inflation target in Average annual inflation was in with the twelvemonth change in consumer prices not falling below in any month of the year. The MNBs monetary policy has its impact on inflation with a lag of several months which should be taken into account when assessing performance in meeting the inflation target. Accordingly deviations of the consumer price index from the inflation target of at most ± percentage point are acceptable ex post in terms of price stability. Taking account of these factors the inflation target was not met in .Significantly above target inflation in mainly reflected the effects of increases in indirect taxes and rises in the prices of noncore items. The pace of underlying inflation was more moderate but slightly higher than in the period. This may suggest that companies spare production capacity was partly reduced and as a result the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand became smaller in. The indirect tax increases at the start of allowed coordinated price hikes with companies presumably bringing forward other price increases as well. This may have been reflected in the sharp rise in services inflation at the beginning of the year which however slowed gradually during the course of the year. Developments in tradables inflation show a similar pattern where the depreciation of the forint in the second half of also contributed to the higher indices at the beginning of the year in addition to the coordinated price increases. Food prices susceptible to cost shocks were raised significantly by unfavourable weather conditions last year. However the slow passthrough of cost shocks into processed food prices suggests that weakening consumer demand may restrain companies intentions to raise prices in the food market as well.To summarise government measures resulted in a significant increase in the consumer price index in. The increases in VAT and excise duties at the start of the year followed by the increase in the telecommunications tax in the middle of the year and another increase in excuse taxes directly raised consumer prices. In addition to the tax increases directly affecting prices fiscal policy contributed indirectly to rising inflation. In the weak economic environment the administrative wage increases raised unit labour costs sharply which in turn put upward pressure on inflation from the cost side. However as in developments in administered prices were moderate in exerting downward pressure on inflation.MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,97,2013
2013-02-26,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from February .In the Monetary Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last years recession. The level of output is below its potential and unemployment is above its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Monetary Council expects weak demand conditions to persist which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead.Inflation in January slowed more than anticipated. The decline was related to a wide range of goods and services. This coupled with the marked slowdown in underlying inflation may reflect the strongerthanexpected disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. The shortterm outlook for inflation improved significantly as a result of the lowerthanprojected price increases around the start of the year and the government measures affecting the prices of items excluded from the core measure. However the extent to which companies will be able to pass on higher production costs into prices in response to the government measures may be a source of uncertainty for the mediumterm inflation outlook. The Monetary Council will therefore continue to monitor closely developments in underlying inflation.According to preliminary data in the final quarter of last year the performance of the Hungarian economy fell by more than expected. Growth is likely to resume this year following last years recession as the countrys export markets recover however external and domestic demand factors in particular point to only modest growth in the period ahead. In the Monetary Councils judgement there remains a degree of spare capacity in the economy output continues to be significantly below its potential level and the labour market remains loose. The weakness in investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the potential growth rate of the economy is significantly below its precrisis level.Global risk appetite has remained strong over the past month but the contrast between improved investor sentiment in international financial markets and the modest outlook for growth in the world economy continues to pose a risk. Meanwhile domestic risk premia have remained broadly stable. The success of the foreign currencydenominated bond issue by the Government has reduced financing risks for the economy. Cooperation with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund might contribute to a further reduction in financing costs and a sustained improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy.In the Monetary Councils judgement the economic data becoming available in the past month suggest that weak demand continues to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices and therefore companies will have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. The favourable global financial market environment may lead to a sustained fall in domestic financial asset prices. In the light of these factors the inflation target can be met even with looser monetary conditions. The Council will consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the mediumterm outlook for inflation remains consistent with the Banks target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,98,2013
2013-03-26,Expecting a strong disinflationary effect from the real side of the economy and a sustained improvement in perceptions of risk the Monetary Council has started a cautious sequence of interest rate reductions from August. In the period from December to February the Monetary Council continued the series of reductions in the central bank base rate that began last August. With these successive reductions in official interest rates the base rate fell to. per cent. The Councils decisions reflected the view that looking forward weak demand would have a substantial disinflationary impact on the economy which would increasingly dominate inflation developments as the indirect tax increases keeping inflation high last year dissipated thereby helping to meet the Banks inflation target. In its February press release the Monetary Council indicated that it would consider a further reduction in interest rates if the mediumterm outlook for inflation remained consistent with the Banks per cent target and the favourable financial market conditions continued to persist. Due to the reductions in utilities prices and the strong downward pressure stemming from the demand side inflation fell below the Banks inflation target at the beginning of this year. There was a general slowdown in global economic activity towards the end of last year. The euroarea recession deepened and the global growth outlook worsened. In developed economies the expected turning point may be further delayed with growth only likely to pick up materially in. Measures of inflation in the advanced regions of the world were close to or slightly below central banks targets in line with the weakness in demand. Against the background of low inflation and the subdued outlook for growth central banks of developed economies continued their stimulus programmes which contributed to the improvement in financial market sentiment while ensuring that strong capital inflows into emerging market economies were maintained. However the contrast between economic activity and developments in financial markets still remains. The Monetary Council expects that the crisis management efforts by European economies will live up to the expectations and that activity on the Continent will stabilise in the short term before picking up gradually. Hungarian economic data for recent months have been weaker than expected and inflation fell sharply in the first months of. The annual consumer price index dropped below the Banks per cent target by February. External and domestic factors both contributed to the decline in GDP towards the end of last year and temporary cuts in production for idiosyncratic reasons in some sectors of the economy exacerbated the decline. The slowdown in Hungarys export markets led to a moderation in the pace of export growth while domestic demand having key importance in terms of pricing decisions continued to be subdued. The gradual reduction in debt stocks accumulated during the years prior to the crisis generally tight credit conditions and uncertainty surrounding the outlook for activity all point to cautious investment and consumption decisions. Reductions in utilities prices at the start of the year led to a material slowdown in consumer price inflation. In the subdued demand environment companies have limited ability to raise consumer prices. Increases in the prices of nonregulated goods and services were also generally low at the beginning of the year. In the continued benign external market environment premia on domestic financial assets remained broadly stable until February before increasing in March.GDP may grow again in this year in line with strengthening exports. A pickup in domestic demand and a more balanced structure of growth is expected from. In the Councils judgement domestic demand conditions remain weak. Taking into account oneoff factors significantly affecting some sectors agriculture manufacturing following the deeperthanexpected recession of economic activity is likely to pick up gradually in the coming quarters. In the short term the fading effect of last years temporary shocks may contribute to the resumption of growth. Exports are likely to remain the most important source of growth. A tangible recovery in domestic demand is unlikely before. Although demand in Hungarys major export markets is only expected to pick up slowly the countrys export market share is expected to increase as production related to new capacities built up in the automobile industry in recent years picks up. In the low inflation environment household real income growth is expected to resume. However due to the protracted deleveraging process and increased uncertainty the household savings rate may remain persistently high and therefore consumer demand is likely to strengthen mainly from. Tight lending conditions and low capacity utilisation may lead companies to postpone investment. Corporate investment is expected to pick up next year in line with the improving outlook for growth. Labour market activity is expected to recover in the coming years. However in the face of the uncertain outlook for demand companies have limited ability to absorb additional labour supply and therefore public work programmes may continue to play a key role in employment growth. Companies may choose to restore their profitability by cutting production costs and wage costs in particular rather than by raising consumer prices. Persistent slack in the labour market exerts strong downward pressure on wages. The rate of real wage growth may be slower than the improvement in productivity in the coming years. The job protection action plan implemented from this year may lead to a general improvement in the chances of employee groups affected by the programme to find a job. However the Governments tax measures point to increases in companies productions costs and a resulting need to adjust. The consumer price index may remain below the Banks inflation target over the entire forecast horizon. Despite the recessionary environment the consumer price index remained above target last year. High inflation mainly reflected the effects of commodity price shocks and increases in indirect taxes meanwhile the pace of underlying inflation was moderate. Incoming data from the start of the year indicate a turning point in inflation supporting the Councils view that subdued demand exerted strong downward pressure on prices. Inflation is likely to fall further in the near term reflecting base effects and reductions in utilities prices by the Government. The upward impact on costs of the increasing the tax burden on certain sectors may pass through to the entire corporate sector along the production chain which may lead to an increase in core inflation adjusted for indirect taxes. With the output gap remaining negative the passing on of higher costs into consumer prices may be slow and partial. As a result of these factors inflation may remain below the per cent target throughout the year and settle close to the target value in. The net external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy is likely to increase further in the coming years. As a result the high level of external debt built up before the crisis may decrease further. In the Councils judgement the net external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy is likely to increase further in the coming years. The improvement in the countrys external position reflects the growing surplus on the balance of goods and services in addition to the steady increase in the amount of EU transfers. Meanwhile the income account has been deteriorating. In line with the budget act the fiscal deficit is likely to be below per cent of GDP both in and. For the time being however there is no accepted budget for. The Governments commitment to keeping the deficit at low levels contributes to the longterm sustainability of the fiscal position. The outlook for both inflation and the real economy points to a further easing in monetary conditions. Over the previous period inflation in Hungary typically remained above target and economic output significantly below its potential level. In its press releases the Monetary Council indicated that it judged the disinflationary impact of weak demand to be significant which would reduce mediumterm inflation risks and therefore the inflation target could be met as the inflationary effects of costs shocks to the economy faded. However changes in perceptions of risks materially influenced the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. Ensuring stability of financial markets required a cautious approach to policy. The inflation data becoming available around the start of the year underpinned the Councils view that subdued demand exerted strong downward pressure on prices. The outlook for inflation and the real economy point to a further easing in monetary conditions. Therefore monetary policy can support economic growth consistent with its mandate without jeopardising the objective of achieving and maintaining price stability. However volatility in the financial market environment has increased in recent months following the marked improvement last year. Developments in monetary conditions are surrounded by risks owing to uncertainty related to the level of spare capacity in the economy developments in bank lending and the global financial market environment. There is considerable uncertainty around the macroeconomic outlook and financial market developments. The Council judges that the most important risks are related to the size of spare capacity in the economy as well as future developments in bank lending and in risk perceptions. In the Councils judgement the potential growth rate of the Hungarian economy slowed substantially reflecting the decline in investment activity and the existing financing constraints however there is significant uncertainty about the size of the loss of productive capacity. If productive capacity has been damaged only to a smaller extent then the cyclical position of the economy may be wider. With a wider cyclical position the ability of companies to pass on cost shocks into prices is more limited and the inflationary impact of cost shocks to companies is smaller which in turn warrants an additional easing of policy. Developments in lending will have a strong impact on the speed of recovery from the recession. The Councils past interest rate reductions have led to lower lending rates however it is difficult to judge precisely the extent to which this would give a boost to lending. If lower lending rates provide a stimulus to investment activity and bolster household consumption through a pickup in lending the recovery of the economy from the crisis may be faster and may not require a further easing of monetary policy overall. Changes in risk perceptions may materially influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils judgement a risk is that the dichotomy between benign global financial market conditions and weak real economic performance has not eased. If there is a significant reduction in global risk appetite risk premia on domestic financial assets may rise significantly. The Monetary Council voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points. In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of spare capacity in the economy inflationary pressure is likely to remain moderate in the medium term and therefore the per cent target can be met with looser monetary conditions. Recent financial market tensions have led to fluctuations in Hungarian asset prices which cannot be justified by fundamental forces which continues to warrant a cautious approach to policy. Considering these factors the Monetary Council decided to reduce the base rate by basis points. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates if mediumterm inflationary pressures remain moderate and the uncertainty surrounding financial market developments diminishes.,99,2013
2013-04-23,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from April .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last years recession. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment above its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead.Recent inflation data have confirmed that weak domestic demand exerts strong downward pressure on prices. Inflation fell back to below the Banks target reflecting the effects of the reduction in administered prices at the beginning of the year and subdued demand. The upward impact on costs of fiscal measures leading to a higher tax burden on certain sectors of the economy may feed through gradually to the entire corporate sector along the production chain which in turn may lead to higher core inflation adjusted for indirect taxes. However the Council judges that with the output gap remaining negative the passing on of increased costs into consumer prices may be slow and partial. Inflation is likely to remain below the per cent target throughout this year and settle close to the target value in .External and domestic factors both contributed to weak activity data towards the end of last year while temporary cuts in production in some sectors of the economy for idiosyncratic reasons exacerbated the downturn. Growth is expected to resume this year as the countrys export markets improve but external and to a greater extent domestic demand factors point to only modest growth in the period ahead. In the low inflation environment household real income growth is expected to recover. However due to the protracted deleveraging process and increased uncertainty about the economic environment household consumption behaviour is likely to be cautious and the saving rate to be high and therefore consumer demand is likely to strengthen only from .Global risk appetite has remained high over the past month. Risk premia on Hungarian financial assets fell significantly reflecting an improvement in the international environment. In the Councils judgement however the contrast between the benign financial market environment and weak real economic activity still remains despite intensified efforts by the international community which warrants a cautious approach to policy.In the Councils judgement the economic data becoming available in the past month suggest that weak demand continues to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices and therefore companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. Based on this assessment the outlook for inflation and the real economy is consistent with a lower central bank base rate. The Council will consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the mediumterm outlook for inflation remains in line with the Banks per cent target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at pm on May .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,100,2013
2013-05-28,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from May .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last years recession. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead.Inflation slowed sharply in April partly related to developments in the prices of noncore items. Recent trends in underlying inflation continue to reflect the strong downward pressure of weak domestic demand on prices. The subdued rate of earnings growth suggests that companies are adjusting through the labour market more strongly in response to the increase in production costs and therefore the passthrough into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. Recent developments in energy and commodity prices as well as the forint exchange rate have also contributed to the disinflation process. In the Councils judgement these factors indicate that inflation risks will remain moderate in the medium term.Preliminary data suggest that the Hungarian economy may recover from recession in the first half of. The correction of adverse oneoff shocks at the end of last year may also have contributed significantly to the strong quarteronquarter growth. The main underlying factors driving growth have not changed significantly the outlook for global growth remains weak while precautionary motives continue to be a drag on the recovery in domestic demand. A sustained pickup in growth is likely to occur from the end of the year as demand in Hungarys export markets improves. Risk appetite in global financial markets has remained strong in the past month. In the supportive environment domestic indicators of risk continued to fall. The Council judges however that the contrast between the benign financial market environment and the weak outlook for global growth continues to pose a risk which calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy.In the Councils judgement the incoming economic data suggest that weak demand continues to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices and therefore companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices while they are making stronger adjustment through the labour market. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy have improved. The outlook for inflation and the real economy point to a reduction in interest rates. The Council will consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the mediumterm outlook for inflation remains in line with the Banks per cent target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,101,2013
2013-06-25,The Monetary Council has reduced the level of the central bank base rate in a series of small steps but significantly overall since August. The condition of the real economy and particularly weak domestic demand warranted a significant reduction in the base rate over the entire period while the outlook for inflation shifted in the same direction and changes in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy were supportive. Consequently incoming data and information have confirmed that the Monetary Council had appropriate room to continue the current monetary policy easing cycle. The recent policy actions have been consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target. The Council will maintain a consistent and conservative approach to monetary policy. In addition to the priority of meeting the inflation target in the medium term the Council will also take into account the condition of the real economy and financial stability considerations. Marked and lasting shifts in perceptions of the risks associated with the countrys economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils judgement the mediumterm outlook for inflation remains consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target. In the short term inflation is likely to ease further mainly driven by falls in administered prices and commodity prices while developments in underlying inflation will continue to reflect the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. The inflation rate adjusted for the direct price level increasing effects of indirect taxes is expected remain below per cent over the medium term. In the longer term the effects of government measures increasing production costs in some sectors are likely to feed through to the corporate sector. With capacity utilisation remaining low however the passthrough to consumer prices is likely to be gradual and partial. Looking forward companies efforts to rebuild profitability loose labour market conditions and the adjustment of inflation expectations are likely to lead to historically low earnings growth which in turn may contribute to the maintenance of the low inflation environment. Overall inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. Global economic activity picked up in the first quarter of. But the risk of a multispeed growth environment amidst the global recovery increased. Following the improvement in the previous period sentiment in international financial markets weakened while indicators of real economic activity remained subdued. The major central banks maintained or eased further monetary conditions in the past quarter in line with the fragile economic situation and the low inflation environment. In terms of perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy sentiment in global financial markets was supportive over the past quarter but investor uncertainty has increased recently. Hungarian economic growth resumed in the first quarter of. The rate of domestic growth which was favourable in an international comparison was also supported by the adjustment affecting output in some sectors of the economy at the beginning of the year. However the slow improvement in underlying growth suggests that the expansion of domestic GDP may continue in the next quarters. Growth is likely to be driven by exports and new capacity created in the automobile industry may contribute to an increase in Hungarys export market share even as external demand remains subdued. Domestic demand is expected to stabilise this year following the decline in previous years. Household real income is expected to grow markedly this year but the reduction in debts accumulated in previous years tight lending conditions and precautionary motives may impede a faster recovery in consumption. The Council expects corporate investment to fall this year as the investment projects in the automobile industry are completed. With the outlook for demand improving a tangible improvement in investment is likely to occur which may be supported by favourable lending conditions for small and mediumsized enterprises resulting from the Funding for Growth Scheme. A material recovery in domestic demand is expected. Hungarys current account adjustment has been one of the most significant across European Union countries since the onset of the crisis. The external surplus of the Hungarian economy is expected to increase further in before stabilising at a high level in reflecting the further gradual rise in net exports and the increased use of EU transfers. The countrys external liabilities and debt are likely to continue to fall as the external balance improves further which may contribute to a reduction in Hungarys external vulnerability. The government deficit on an accrual basis is expected to remain below per cent of GDP both in and. Gross government deficit is likely to remain on a downward path over the forecast period and fall below per cent by. In the Councils judgement the achievement of the mediumterm inflation target and the condition of the real economy allow further cautious monetary policy easing. In the Councils view the economic data becoming available in the first half of the year suggest that weak domestic demand and slack in the labour market have a strong disciplinary effect on economic agents price and wagesetting decisions while temporary effects have also contributed to a reduction in inflation this year. The taxadjusted inflation rate is expected to remain below per cent over the medium term the direct upward effect on prices of the Governments tax measures is outside the influence of monetary policy. The low inflation environment may help to better anchor the nominal path of the real economy to the Banks inflation target. Looking ahead the output of the Hungarian economy is likely to return to its potential level only gradually which suggests that inflationary pressures will remain moderate as the temporary effects dissipate. The latter will also be supported by developments in underlying inflation and the subdued rate of earnings growth. The Council judges that the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and the position of the real economy warrant further monetary policy easing. However changes in risk perceptions represent a risk in terms of the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. There is significant uncertainty surrounding future developments in the macroeconomy and financial markets. In the Councils judgement the degree of spare capacity in the economy and the global financial market environment are the two most important sources of uncertainty for monetary policy. The potential output of the Hungarian economy has been growing at a slow rate since the onset of the crisis reflecting the decline in investment and the existing financing constraints however there continues to be a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounding the size of available capacity that could be brought into production. If productive capacity has been damaged to a smaller extent then the path of potential output may be higher and the cyclical position of the economy may be wider. With a wider cyclical position the ability of companies to pass on cost shocks into prices is more limited and the inflationary impact of cost shocks to companies is smaller which in turn may warrant a further substantial easing of policy. In the Councils view global financial markets have become more fragile recently. Developments related to the quantitative easing programmes implemented by leading central banks will be key in sustaining the supportive financial market environment. A further uncertainty arises from the possibility that the euroarea recession will be more prolonged despite the significant efforts by European institutions. A marked deterioration in the financial environment may limit the room in which monetary policy can manoeuvre. Based on the above considerations the Monetary Council has decided to reduce the base rate by basis points. In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of spare capacity in the economy inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term and therefore the per cent target can be met with looser monetary conditions. However the global financial market environment has been volatile recently. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. The Council judges that as long as the outlook for inflation and the real economy justifies it interest rates can be reduced further however increased caution is warranted in the volatile and rapidly changing global environment.,102,2013
2013-07-23,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from July .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last years recession. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead.In the Councils judgement the rate of price increases affecting the general consumer price level caused by the regulatory price measures taken to ensure the comovement of producer and consumer prices between and fell to around half after. This indicates a change in the approach of economic policy to inflation. Consequently inflation in is expected to fall back to around per cent even excluding the effect of the reduction in utilities prices.Inflation remained low in June. Historically low inflation is partly related to developments in the prices of noncore items. In addition measures of underlying inflation have fallen further and have been at low levels since the beginning of the year reflecting the strong downward pressure of weak domestic demand on prices. The low rate of earnings growth suggests that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through labour costs and therefore the passthrough into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. In the Councils judgement these factors indicate that underlying inflation remains subdued and risks to inflation will be moderate over the medium term.The Hungarian economy is likely to recover from recession in. The main underlying factors driving growth have not changed significantly the outlook for global growth remains weak while precautionary motives continue to be a drag on the recovery in domestic demand. A sustained pickup in growth is likely to occur from the end of the year as demand in Hungarys export markets improves. The external balance of the economy remains favourable.In the Councils view risk appetite in global financial markets has been highly volatile over the past month. Domestic indicators of risk declined despite increased uncertainty in the global financial environment and no significant selloff of domestic assets occurred. In the Monetary Councils assessment increased volatility in sentiment in global financial markets and the uncertain outlook for global economic growth continue to pose a risk which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy.In the Councils judgement there is a significant degree of spare capacity in the Hungarian economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate even over the medium term. Data becoming available over the past month confirm that weak demand has exerted a strong disinflationary impact and therefore companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. Consequently easier monetary policy will ensure that the per cent inflation target is achieved. However global financial markets have been volatile recently. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. The significant reductions in interest rates so far and the volatile conditions in financial markets may justify changing the pace or extent of policy easing over the coming months.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,103,2013
2013-08-27,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from August .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to recover gradually this year however the level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist which ensures that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the medium term.Data for July indicate that inflation remained at historically low levels. Although temporary factors have also contributed to the decline in inflation the persistently low rate of underlying inflation measures reflects the strong downward pressure of weak domestic demand on prices. Low wage dynamics suggest that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through labour costs rather than through consumer prices and therefore the passthrough into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. In the Councils judgement these factors indicate that there is no significant inflationary pressure in the Hungarian economy and that risks to inflation could remain moderate over the medium term which in turn will help anchor inflation expectations. In the current environment monetary policy can contribute to meeting the inflation target over the medium term by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions.The Hungarian economy has recovered from recession this year. The improvement in domestic demand is likely to be slow and gradual due to ongoing deleveraging and cautious behaviour by households while activity in external markets mainly in developed economies is showing signs of a revival. However there is uncertainty about future developments in external demand caused by the slowdown in growth in emerging regions of the world. A sustained pickup in growth is likely to occur from the end of the year as demand in Hungarys export markets improves.Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased slightly in the uncertain global financial environment. In the Monetary Councils assessment higher volatility in sentiment in global financial markets continues to pose a risk which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy.In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is characterised by significant unused capacity and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. Incoming data continue to suggest that weak demand has exerted a strong disinflationary impact and as a result companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. Consequently a more accommodative monetary policy stance would ensure that the inflation target is achieved over the medium term. After some temporary stabilisation global financial markets have become more volatile again. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils judgement incoming data on inflation and the real economy give scope to ease monetary conditions further. However in light of the significant reduction in interest rates so far and taking into account developments in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy a slower pace of policy easing is warranted.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,104,2013
2013-09-24,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from September. Since August the Monetary Council has reduced the level of the central bank base rate in a series of cautious steps but to a substantial extent overall. Over the period the condition of the real economy and particularly weak domestic demand warranted a significant reduction in the base rate while the outlook for inflation remained consistent with the achievement of the per cent target over the medium term. Changes in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy were supportive throughout the period. The substantial easing in monetary policy so far and higher volatility in sentiment in global financial markets in the past month have called for increased caution. The Council is seeking to maintain a balanced and conservative approach to monetary policy. In addition to the priority of meeting the inflation target the Council will also take into account the condition of the real economy and pay particular regard to financial stability considerations. Marked and lasting shifts in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils judgement currently there is no material inflationary pressure in the economy. In recent months the Banks measures of underlying inflation have fallen to historically low levels. Favourable developments in underlying inflation reflect the combined effect of subdued domestic demand declining inflationary pressures in external markets and the gradual adjustment of inflation expectations. The reductions in regulated prices implemented in a series of steps this year have also contributed to the development of a low inflation environment. In the longer term the effects of government measures increasing production costs in some sectors are likely to feed through to the corporate sector. With domestic demand remaining subdued however the passthrough to consumer prices is likely to be gradual and partial. Looking forward companies efforts to rebuild profitability loose labour market conditions and the adjustment of inflation expectations are likely to lead to moderate earnings growth which in turn may contribute to the maintenance of the low inflation environment. Overall inflationary pressures are likely to remain muted over the medium term. The global environment points to the maintenance of persistently accommodative monetary conditions. Global activity was driven by developed economies in the second half of the year. By contrast economic activity in developing countries whose share of Hungarian exports has been increasing was weaker than expected. Looking ahead the significant differences in growth rates across the most important economic regions are likely to narrow with the slow expansion in external demand in the second half expected to continue next year. Demandside inflationary pressures remain weak as economic growth continues at a moderate pace. In response developed country central banks have maintained loose monetary conditions. In terms of perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy sentiment in global financial markets have been broadly supportive however sentiment deteriorated and risk aversion increased in markets in the past quarter. In addition to developments in the euroarea debt crisis expectations related to the liquidity measures by major central banks and risks facing large emerging economies were the main factors influencing investor decisions. Looking ahead the Monetary Council expects the pattern of growth to be more balanced. Economic growth is likely to pick up gradually in the coming quarters. Both exports and domestic demand are expected to contribute to the slow improvement in underlying growth. Exports are likely to remain the main driving force behind growth in addition to the recovery in external demand the increase in the market share of Hungarian exports is expected to contribute to export growth due to the instalment of new capacity in the automobile industry. Low inflation and wage increases for certain employee groups in the public sector are expected to boost the purchasing power of households disposable income. However household caution is only likely to diminish as debts accumulated in the past are reduced. In addition to the investment projects implemented by the Government from EU funds private sector investment demand is likely to remain moderate reflecting unused capacity the uncertain outlook for growth and tight credit conditions. However the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme is expected to contribute to an easing in financing constraints for small and mediumsized enterprises thereby supporting the recovery in private investment. Overall demand is likely to remain below the productive capacity of the economy and therefore the real economic environment is expected to remain disinflationary looking ahead. The negative output gap may close at the end of the forecast horizon. External debt is likely to fall further. The external surplus of the Hungarian economy is likely to rise further this year reflecting a rising surplus on goods and services partly due to the improvement in the terms of trade the expected decline in the income deficit and the increasing use of EU transfers. In however the surplus on goods and services is unlikely to rise further partly reflecting higher investment and imports as a result of the Funding for Growth Scheme while the amount of EU transfers is likely to fall due to the new budget cycle. But with the external financing capacity remaining high the external debt ratio is likely to fall further which in turn will reduce the countrys vulnerability. In the Councils judgement the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and the condition of the real economy continue warrant further cautious easing of policy. In the Councils view the economic data becoming available in the course of the year indicate that weak domestic demand and loose labour market conditions have a strong disciplinary effect on economic agents price and wagesetting decisions. Although temporary effects have also contributed to the reduction in inflation underlying developments point to continued moderate inflationary pressure even in the medium term. There continues to be significant spare capacity in the economy and output is likely to return to its potential level only gradually. As a result of these factors inflation is likely to remain persistently below the per cent target before returning to it at the monetary policy horizon. The low inflation environment may help the Banks inflation target to better anchor the nominal path of the economy. Taking into account developments in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target can be ensured with policy easing which is more cautious than usual. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by a range of uncertainties. In the Councils judgement the degree and disinflationary impact of spare capacity in the economy as well as uncertainty around the global financial market environment are the two most important sources of risk to monetary policy. There are both upside and downside risks to developments in investment and consequently to the future path of the economys potential output. In the Councils view the potential output of the Hungarian economy has been growing at a slow rate since the outset of the crisis reflecting weak investment and the existing financing constraints however the size of available capacity that could be brought into production is surrounded by a considerable degree of uncertainty. A wider cyclical position and lower inflation expectations may lead to stronger disinflation through price and wagesetting decisions which in turn may warrant a further substantial easing of policy. In the Councils judgement possible developments in the external environment both in terms of the real economy and financial markets may adversely affect perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy and limit the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. Looking ahead the recovery in investment may be faster if companies spend a greater portion of loans received under the Funding for Growth Scheme to finance additional and sustainable investment. If the decline in investment experienced during the crisis proves longer than expected it may result in a less favourable path. Based on the above considerations the Monetary Council has decided to reduce the base rate by basis points. In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of spare capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. Achieving the per cent inflation target over the medium term provides scope for further monetary policy easing. Global financial markets are showing signs of stabilisation following a period of increased volatility. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy.

2013-10-29,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from October. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy is likely to expand gradually this year followed by a further pickup in growth next year. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects external economic activity to strengthen and weak domestic demand conditions to persist. As a result inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued in the medium term.Data for September suggest that inflationary pressures remain low. Recent movements in the consumer prices index have also reflected temporary effects. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing mediumterm developments in inflation remained broadly unchanged relative to previous months. The low rate of underlying inflation since the beginning of the year reflects the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. Subdued wage dynamics suggest that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through the labour market and therefore the passthrough into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. The low inflation environment may help anchor inflation expectations. In the Councils judgement therefore inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate close to the target over the medium term as the temporary effects wane. In the current environment monetary policy can contribute to meeting the inflation target over the medium term by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions.Economic growth is likely to improve gradually in the coming quarters supported by both exports and domestic demand components. The improvement in domestic demand is likely to be gradual reflecting ongoing deleveraging and the cautious behaviour of households. Export growth is expected to continue in line with the rate of growth of external demand which is expected to pick up markedly starting from the end of this year.Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have improved over the past month. Uncertainties about the tapering of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve followed by the disagreements over the US federal budget led to volatility in global financial markets. However these concerns diminished towards the end of the period. In the Councils judgement changes in sentiment in global financial markets continue to pose a risk which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy.In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. Inflation is expected to remain around the target over the forecast period which provides scope to ease monetary policy further. Global financial markets have stabilised following a period of increased volatility. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils view considering the outlook for inflation and the real economy and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy further cautious easing of monetary conditions may follow.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on November .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,106,2013
2013-11-26,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from November .In the Councils judgement the expansion of the Hungarian economy is likely to continue this year followed by a further pickup in growth next year. While the pace of activity is strengthening the level of output remains below its potential and high but falling unemployment exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. The Council expects external economic activity to strengthen gradually and weak domestic demand conditions to persist. As a result inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued in the medium term.Inflation continued to fall in October mainly reflecting developments in food and administered prices in addition to the decline in fuel prices. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing mediumterm developments in inflation remained broadly unchanged relative to previous months. The low rate of underlying inflation since the beginning of the year reflects the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand and the external environment. Subdued wage dynamics suggest that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through the labour market and therefore the passthrough into consumer prices is likely to be limited and gradual. The low inflation environment may help anchor inflation expectations. In the Councils judgement therefore inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. In the current environment monetary policy can contribute to meeting the inflation target over the medium term by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions.The preliminary estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter suggests a gradual improvement in the outlook for economic growth. Growth is expected to pick up further in the coming quarters with both exports and domestic demand components likely to be contributing to this. The improvement in domestic demand is likely to be gradual reflecting ongoing deleveraging and the cautious behaviour of households. Export growth is likely to continue in line with the expansion in external demand which is expected to pick up markedly starting from the end of this year.Overall the global financial environment has been volatile recently due to uncertainty about the future of nonconventional measures used by global central banks. There has been a slight deterioration in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy simultaneously with a new wave of capital outflows from emerging markets. In the Councils judgement the global financial environment remains supportive overall but volatile sentiment in global financial markets continues to pose a risk which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy.In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. A further reduction in interest rates is consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Global financial markets continue to be volatile. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils view considering the outlook for inflation and the real economy and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy further cautious easing of policy may follow.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,107,2013
2013-12-17,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from December. Since August the Monetary Council has reduced the base rate significantly The reduction in the base rate was justified by the low inflation environment subdued inflationary pressures over the medium term and a degree of spare capacity in the economy. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy were supportive throughout the period. In the Councils judgement the significant reduction in the base rate implemented since August contributed to the recovery in domestic economic growth and enabled the Bank to meet its mediumterm inflation target. The Council is seeking to maintain a balanced and conservative approach to monetary policy. In addition to the priority of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. A marked and sustained shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Councils judgement there is no material inflationary pressure in the Hungarian economy In recent months the consumer price index and the measures of underlying inflation have been at historically low levels. Low underlying inflation reflects the combined effect of weak domestic demand declining inflationary pressures in external markets and the gradual adjustment of inflation expectations. In addition to the decline in underlying inflation the reductions in regulated prices implemented in a series of steps this year have also contributed significantly to the development of a low inflation environment. Looking forward loose labour market conditions and the adjustment of inflation expectations are likely to lead to moderate wage growth which in turn may contribute to the maintenance of the low inflation environment. On the whole inflationary pressures are likely to remain muted over the medium term with inflation expected to move into line with the target by the end of the forecast period. The Council judges that the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in and looking ahead expects economic growth to continue Hungarian economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously. Rising exports are likely to play an important role as a source of growth supported by an increase in market share due to the establishment of new production capacity in the automobile industry in addition to the recovery in external activity. Moreover domestic demand is expected to strengthen in the coming years. Wholeeconomy investment is likely to pick up further bolstered by the increasing use of EU funding. Corporate investment is expected to grow driven by the positive economic outlook and the easing of credit constraints due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme. However household consumption is likely to grow only gradually even despite the increase in real income. Propensity to save is expected to remain high reflecting the ongoing reduction in debt built up during the years prior to the crisis and the slow improvement in credit conditions. Hungarys external position is likely to improve further The external surplus of the Hungarian economy is likely to rise further this year reflecting a rising surplus on goods and services partly due to the improvement in the terms of trade the expected moderate decline in the income account deficit and the increasing use of EU transfers. On the forecast horizon the external financing capacity is expected to remain high and the trade surplus to stabilise at its current level while the net amount of EU transfers although falling slightly is likely to exceed the level of previous years due to the new budget cycle of the EU. With the external financing capacity remaining high the external debt ratio is likely to fall further which in turn will reduce the countrys vulnerability. In the Councils view the mediumterm achievement of the price stability and the condition of the real economy provide scope for further cautious monetary policy easing In the Councils judgement the economic data becoming available in the course of the year indicate that weak domestic demand and loose labour market conditions have a strong disciplinary effect on economic agents price and wagesetting decisions. Although temporary effects have also contributed strongly to the reduction in inflation underlying developments point to continued moderate inflationary pressure even in the medium term supported by low inflation in external markets and the gradual fall in inflation expectations. The productive capacity of the economy continues to be lower than optimal with the output gap remaining negative. The negative output gap may close at the end of the forecast horizon mainly driven by the performance of the export sector and the revival of investment. On the other hand household consumption is likely to strengthen only gradually and consequently real economic factors are expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact although to a declining extent. Under the current projection inflation remains significantly below the target next year before moving into line with the rate of change consistent with price stability in even as the output gap closes. The low inflation environment may help the Banks inflation target to better anchor the nominal path of the economy. On the whole the global financial environment has been supportive in the past quarter. However sentiment has been volatile due to uncertainty about the future of unconventional measures used by global central banks which warranted an even more cautious approach to domestic monetary policy. The macroeconomic outlook continues to be surrounded by a range of uncertainties The Monetary Council identified several alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the December Report. Two of these scenarios represent risks relevant to the future conduct of monetary policy. In the Councils judgement the alternative scenarios allowing for the possibility of a lower inflation environment on the one hand and a potential increase in investor risk aversion as a result of external developments on the other imply a different monetary policy stance relative to the baseline projection. In addition the Monetary Council perceives upside risks to growth linked to the pickup in corporate lending and the stimulatory impact of the Funding for Growth Scheme. Under the alternative scenario assuming a lower inflation environment the ratio of unused domestic and external capacities available may be higher than assumed in the baseline projection which in turn may imply more subdued domestic wage dynamics and a sharper decline in external inflationary pressure and therefore the inflation target can be met with a persistently more accommodative monetary policy conditions. Under the alternative scenario assuming an unfavourable external environment and higher investor risk aversion a sustained and marked shift in risk perceptions related to the economy points to the adoption of a tighter policy stance. A stronger pickup in lending than assumed in the baseline projection may lead to an improvement in the longterm growth potential of the economy through a stimulus to productive investment and therefore it does not imply a markedly different policy response from that assumed in the baseline projection. Based on the above considerations the Monetary Council has decided to reduce the base rate by basis points In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. Global financial markets continue to be volatile. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. The projection in the December Report implies that further policy easing is likely to be required in order to deliver price stability in the medium term. Considering perceptions of the risks associated with the economy as well as the improvement in the pace of economic growth further easing of monetary policy may follow but a reduction in the increment is likely to be warranted in the future.,108,2013
2014-01-21,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from January. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue this year and next. While the pace of activity is strengthening the level of output remains below its potential and is likely to return close to that level at the end of the horizon relevant for monetary policy. With employment rising steadily the unemployment rate is falling but still exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued over the medium term. Inflation continued to fall in December mainly as a result of the reduction in regulated energy prices in November. In addition to the temporary factors reducing inflation the Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook also indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy which reflects the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may facilitate the adjustment of inflation expectations. The rate of private sector wage growth has picked up slightly recently but still remains moderate. Domestic real economic factors are expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact although to a declining extent as activity rises further. Incoming data showed that economic growth continued in the fourth quarter as reflected by monthly data on industrial production the trade surplus construction output and retail trade turnover. Economic growth is expected to continue in the quarters ahead and is likely to be more balanced than previously. Domestic demand is expected to grow over the next years in addition to rising exports. With the increase in corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme and the Governments infrastructure projects using EU funding the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. Growth in real income is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debt accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. Global investor sentiment has remained supportive despite the Feds decision to reduce the pace of its asset purchases at the end of last year. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy improved as reflected in the declines in CDS spreads and bond yields. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt act to reduce the countrys vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment. In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. Delivering price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing. The global financial environment remained supportive. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. Considering the outlook for inflation and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy as well as the improvement in the pace of economic growth further cautious easing of monetary policy may follow but a reduction in the increment has become warranted.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,109,2014
2014-02-18,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from February. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue this year and next. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below its potential and is likely to come close to that level again at the end of the horizon relevant for monetary policy. With employment rising the unemployment rate is falling but still exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued over the medium term. Global investor sentiment has been volatile recently and perceptions of the risks associated with Hungary and other economies of the region have deteriorated. Inflation continued to fall in January mainly as a result of the moderation in fuel prices. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook rose relative to the previous month but continued to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy which reflects the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. The rate of private sector wage growth has picked up somewhat recently but still remains moderate. Domestic real economic factors are expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact although to a declining extent as activity rises further. Incoming data showed that economic growth continued in the fourth quarter of. According to the preliminary release GDP growth in the fourth quarter of was stronger than market expectations. Growth is expected to pick up further in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced pattern. With the increase in corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme and the Governments infrastructure projects using EU funding the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. Growth in real income is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debt accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. Global investor sentiment has been volatile recently as a result of the Feds decision to reduce further the pace of its asset purchases and the deterioration in perceptions of the risks associated with emerging economies. A number of emerging market currencies came under heavy selling pressure. Looking forward however the euroarea policy rate is expected to remain at low levels for an extended period. Perceptions of the risks associated with Hungary and other economies of the region deteriorated as reflected in rises in CDS spreads and bond yields and higher volatility of the forint exchange rate. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment. Nevertheless Hungarys position is fundamentally strong compared to other emerging market economies. The countrys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. The current account has moved into surplus reflecting the significant adjustment by the government and private sectors thereby reducing the countrys external debt and the economys reliance on external financing. In the Councils judgement there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Delivering price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing. Conditions in global financial markets have been volatile recently. In the Councils judgement there remained scope for reducing interest rates in the context of increased uncertainty in financial markets. The room for manoeuvre in monetary policy taking into account financial stability considerations continues to be influenced by the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target a corresponding degree of support to the economy and a sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy. The Monetary Council will decide on the need and possibility for continuing the easing cycle after a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and developments in perceptions of the risks about the economy in view of the baseline projection and alternative scenarios of the March forecast. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March. MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,110,2014
2014-03-25,March At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from March. Since August the Monetary Council has reduced the central bank base rate significantly These reductions in the base rate were justified by the low inflation environment subdued inflationary pressures over the medium term and a degree of spare capacity in the economy. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy were also generally supportive. In the Councils judgement the significant reduction in the base rate implemented so far has helped the Bank achieve the inflation target over the medium term and has contributed to the strengthening of domestic economic growth. The Councils aim remains to maintain a balanced and conservative approach to monetary policy. In addition to the priority of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. A marked and sustained shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. Looking ahead inflation is likely to move in line with price stability disinflation is expected to slow gradually In the Councils judgement inflation is likely to remain below the per cent target in before moving into line with the mediumterm inflation target from. The inflation rate has been at historically low levels in recent months. Subdued inflation in external markets the degree of unused capacity in the economy the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in regulated prices implemented in a series of steps have contributed to the development of a low inflation environment. However the weaker exchange rate of recent months has passed through gradually to the prices of core inflation items which in turn points to higher underlying inflation. Capacity utilisation is likely to rise gradually as economic activity continues to recover. Household consumption however which is relevant in terms of inflation pressures from the domestic real economy is likely to grow only slowly and therefore the real economic environment is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact although to a declining extent. In addition the loose labour market and the adjustment of inflation expectations also suggest that moderate wage growth is likely to continue which in turn will contribute to inflation moving in line with the Banks inflation target looking forward. The low inflation environment may help the Banks inflation target to better anchor the nominal path of the economy. The Council judges that the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in. Looking ahead economic growth is likely to continue Economic activity picked up gradually in the past quarters with output rising across a wide range of sectors. Looking ahead Hungarian economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously. Rising exports are likely to play an important role as a source of growth in the coming years supported by new production capacity in the automobile industry brought into production and the improvement in competitiveness in addition to the recovery in economic activity abroad. Domestic demand is expected to strengthen in the coming years. Investments are likely to pick up further reflecting the improvement in the outlook for activity the easing in credit constraints due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme and the increasing use of EU funding. However household consumption is likely to grow only gradually even as disposable income increases. Propensity to save is expected to remain high reflecting the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow improvement in credit conditions. Hungarys external debt is expected to fall further The external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy continued to rise towards the end of and the external debt ratios fell significantly. The external surplus is likely to remain high in the coming years as the trade surplus stabilises at a high level despite accelerating growth in consumption and investment. The improvement in the terms of trade and the pickup in export growth as external demand recovers are likely to play a dominant role in this. The transfer balance is expected to fall slightly due to the new budget cycle of the EU but is likely to remain above levels recorded in previous years. With the external financing capacity remaining high the external debt ratio is likely to fall further which in turn will reduce the countrys vulnerability. The Hungarian risk premium did not change significantly in the past quarter but volatility increased in financial markets Due to the Feds decision to further reduce the pace of its asset purchases the increased focus on the vulnerability of some emerging economies and the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia global investor sentiment has been volatile in the past quarter. Domestic risk premia have been little changed since publication of the December issue of the Banks Quarterly Report on Inflation. The CDS spread and the spreads on foreign currency bonds fell slightly longterm yields rose modestly and the exchange rate depreciated accompanied by significant volatility. The volatility of the major risk indicators increased relative to previous quarters. Nevertheless Hungarys position is fundamentally strong compared to other emerging market economies. The countrys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted by uncertainty related to the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks The Monetary Council identified three alternative scenarios around the baseline projection of the MarchReport on Inflation which might significantly influence the future conduct of monetary policy. In the alternative scenario assuming a persistently low external inflation environment and a slowerthanexpected recovery in external demand the inflation target may be achieved with looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline scenario. In the risk scenario assuming an unfavourable external environment and higher investor risk aversion inflation moves in line with price stability in the medium term under tighter monetary conditions than implied by the baseline projection. A third scenario assuming a pickup in domestic employment and consumption resulting in weaker domestic disinflationary pressures also implies a tighter monetary policy stance. After reviewing the projection in the March Report the Council judges that there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation is likely to move in line with the target in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon and therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to decrease looking forward. In the Councils judgement there remained some scope for a cautious reduction in interest rates in the context of heightened uncertainty in global financial markets however a smaller reduction in interest rates than previously was warranted by the increase in uncertainty. Considering the substantial reduction in interest rates so far changes in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy and based on currently available information the central bank base rate has significantly approached a level which ensures the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. In case of a significant deterioration in global financial market environment the Council will see no scope for continuing the easing cycle.

2014-04-29,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from April. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. However while the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below its potential and is likely to return close to that level during next year. With employment rising the unemployment rate is falling but still exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate over the medium term and inflation is likely to move into line with the mediumterm inflation target from. Inflation was unchanged in March relative to the previous month remaining at. per cent. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook remained broadly unchanged and continued to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy which reflects the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. The rate of private sector wage growth has picked up somewhat recently but still remains moderate. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact but demandside disinflationary pressures are weakening as activity gathers pace.Data available since the Councils last interest rate decision show that economic growth continued as reflected in monthly data on industrial output retail sales and the performance of construction. Growth is expected to pick up gradually in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced pattern with domestic demand likely to make an increasing contribution. With the increase in the Governments infrastructure projects using EU funding and in corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. Growth in real incomes is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. According to labour market data for March demand for labour increased and unemployment fell pointing to a tighter labour market looking ahead.Global investor sentiment was volatile in the past month. Market tensions intensified as a result of the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Domestic risk premia fell slightly and the forint exchange rate strengthened showing lower volatility than in the previous month. The countrys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment.In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the policy horizon therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to decrease looking forward and inflation is likely to move in line with the target in the medium term. The slight improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy has provided room for a cautious reduction in interest rates.As the Monetary Council indicated in its March press release the central bank base rate has significantly approached a level which ensures the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the real economy. Over the coming period changes in the domestic and international environment might influence this picture.The Monetary Council always considers carefully the macroeconomic outlook and developments in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy before deciding on the direction and magnitude of the next change in the policy rate.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May.

2014-05-27,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from May .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and is likely to approach that level in the course of next year. With employment rising the unemployment rate is falling but still exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term.Inflation continued to fall in April. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact but demandside disinflationary pressures are weakening as activity gathers pace.Data available since the Councils latest interest rate decision show that economic growth continued as reflected in the Q preliminary GDP release as well as monthly data on industrial output retail sales and the performance of construction. Growth is expected to pick up gradually in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced structure with domestic demand likely to make an increasing contribution. Along with the Governments infrastructure projects using EU funding and rising corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. The expansion in real incomes is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated in the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. According to labour market data for March demand for labour increased and unemployment fell which may point to a tighter labour market going forward.Global investor sentiment has been supportive in the past month but future developments are surrounded by uncertainty due to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Domestic risk premia on balance fell and the forint exchange rate appreciated steadily in the past month. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. The announcement by the MNB about its programme of selffinancing may have also contributed to the improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment.In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the policy horizon however achieving price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing. The improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy provided scope for a further cautious reduction in interest rates. The Monetary Council will decide on the need and possibility of reducing the base rate further after a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and developments in perceptions of the risks about the economy and in view of the baseline projection and alternative scenarios in the June issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on June .MAGYAR NEMZETI BANK Monetary Council,113,2014
2014-06-24,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from June. The monetary councils statement on macroeconomic developments and its monetary policy assessment Since August the Monetary Council has reduced the central bank base rate significantly. The reductions in the base rate during the period were justified by the low inflation environment subdued mediumterm inflationary pressures and a degree of spare capacity in the economy. Risk perceptions associated with the economy were also generally supportive. In the Councils judgement the significant easing of monetary policy implemented so far has helped the Bank achieve the inflation target in the medium term and has contributed to the strengthening of domestic economic growth. The Councils aim is still to maintain a balanced and conservative approach to policy. In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. Inflation is likely to remain low for an extended period and to reach levels around per cent consistent with price stability only at the forecast horizon. In the Councils judgement inflation is likely to remain well below the per cent target in before moving into line with the mediumterm inflation target from the second half of. The dynamics of consumer price inflation have been historically low in recent months. Subdued inflation in external markets the degree of unused capacity in the economy moderate wage growth the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in regulated prices implemented in a series of steps have all contributed to the development of a low inflation environment. At the forecast horizon the domestic real economic environment is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact although to a declining extent. Persistently low inflation alongside rising domestic demand reflects mainly the positive impact of moderate wage growth due to continued slack in the labour market and other supplyside cost shocks. The persistently low inflation environment is expected to help anchor inflation expectations playing a key role in determining the nominal path of the economy more firmly around the Banks inflation target. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in. Looking ahead economic growth is likely to continue. Economic activity has picked up gradually in the past quarters with output rising across a wide range of sectors. Looking ahead Hungarian economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously. Rising exports are likely to play an important role as a source of growth in the coming years as well. In addition domestic demand is also expected to strengthen further. Investment is likely to continue accelerating reflecting the improvement in the outlook for activity the easing in credit constraints also due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme and the increasing use of EU funding. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually resulting from the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. Meanwhile the behaviour of a large number of households continues to be influenced by the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated in the years prior to the crisis and the gradual easing in credit conditions. As a result propensity to save is likely to remain persistently above levels seen in the period prior to the crisis. Despite the pickup in domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. Financing capacity stabilising at high levels falling external debt. The external position of the economy continued to improve towards the end of as reflected in the significant decline in external debt ratios. The trade surplus while remaining substantial in the coming years even as import picks up due to increasing consumption and investment is likely to keep the current account surplus high over the entire forecast period. The slight decline in the income balance deficit is expected to contribute to Hungarys external position remaining strong. On balance the external financing capacity of the economy is likely to remain high despite the slight fall in EU transfers due the new budget cycle. In line with this the countrys debt ratios key indicators in terms of the countrys vulnerability are likely to continue to improve. At the same time the Banks selffinancing programme is expected to help reduce the countrys gross external debt. The Hungarian risk premium has declined significantly in the past quarter. Volatility fell in financial markets. International investor sentiment was volatile in the past quarter mainly reflecting the reduction in the pace of the Feds asset purchases the ECBs interest rate cut and announced new package of policy measures and the continuation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Domestic risk premia have fallen significantly since publication of the March Report. The CDS spread foreign currency bond spreads and longterm yields declined. The exchange rate appreciated. The volatility of the major risk indicators fell relative to the previous quarter. The announcement of the Banks selffinancing concept also contributed to the improvement in risk perceptions associated with the economy. Compared with other emerging market economies Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed significantly to the reduction in its vulnerability. The Monetary Council will continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. In connection with the baseline projection in the June Report the Monetary Council identified three alternative scenarios which might significantly influence the future conduct of monetary policy. In the alternative scenario assuming a persistently low external inflation environment and a slowerthanexpected recovery in external demand the inflation target may be achieved with looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline scenario. In the risk scenario assuming an unfavourable external environment and higher investor risk aversion inflation moves in line with price stability in the medium term under considerably tighter monetary conditions than implied by the baseline projection. A third scenario assuming a pickup in domestic employment and consumption resulting in stronger growth in domestic economic activity also implies a tighter monetary policy stance. After reviewing the projection in the June Report the Council judges that there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon however achieving price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing and the macroeconomic outlook points in the direction of persistently loose monetary conditions. Considering the outlook for inflation and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy and the pickup in economic growth further cautious easing of monetary policy may follow however based on available information the central bank base rate has significantly approached a level which ensures the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. Over the coming period changes in the domestic and international environment might influence this picture.,114,2014
2014-07-22,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from July .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and is likely to approach that level in the course of next year. Despite the pickup in domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising the unemployment rate is falling but still exceeds its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period.Based on the inflation data for June consumer prices continue to show historically low dynamics. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting low inflation in external markets the degree of unused capacity in the economy subdued wage dynamics the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered prices implemented in a series of steps. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However domestic demandside disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace and inflation is likely to reach levels around per cent consistent with price stability at the end of the forecast horizon.Based on data available since the latest interest rate decision economic growth continued as reflected in data for industrial production and retail trade. In the Councils judgement the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in. Looking ahead economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution. Investment is likely to continue accelerating reflecting the increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Based on labour market data for May the number of employees excluding those employed under public employment programmes remained broadly unchanged relative to the previous month and the unemployment rate fell. The labour market is expected to become tighter.International investor sentiment was volatile in the past month mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and weakerthanexpected European macroeconomic data. Hungarian risk premia remained broadly unchanged in the period and the forint exchange rate depreciated slightly with countryspecific factors playing a role in addition to external factors. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. The announcement of the Banks selffinancing concept may contribute to an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the domestic economy. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. In the Councils judgement it was justified to end the easing cycle because of the need to remove uncertainty about the bottom of the interest rate path and the mediumterm achievement of price stability made it necessary to implement a further basis point reduction in interest rates. The Council judges that the central bank base rate has reached a level which ensures the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. That means that the twoyear easing cycle of a significant cumulative reduction of basis points has ended. Looking ahead the macroeconomic outlook points in the direction of persistently loose monetary conditions.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on August .Magyar Nemzeti Bank Monetary Council,115,2014

Looking ahead economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution. The increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme are expected to sustain the recovery in investment. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Based on labour market data for June the number of employees continued to rise and the unemployment rate was unchanged.International investor sentiment deteriorated somewhat in the past month mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and revised expectations of an interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve. Hungarian risk premia remained broadly unchanged in the period and the forint exchange rate depreciated mostly along with other currencies of the region. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. The Banks selffinancing programme may contribute to an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy.

The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish and with current monetary conditions maintained inflation is likely to move into line with the target over the medium term. The Council judges that based on available information the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projection hold achieving the mediumterm inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period.The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .Magyar Nemzeti Bank Monetary Council,116,2014
2014-09-23,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. the monetary councils statement on macroeconomic developments and its monetary policy assessment The Monetary Council finished the twoyear easing cycle in July. With a cumulative basis point reduction the central bank policy rate fell to. per cent as a result of a twoyear easing cycle. In the Councils judgement with the easing cycle finished maintaining the current low level interest rates for an extended period ensures the achievement of the Banks mediumterm inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. Inflation is likely to remain close to zero per cent this year before rising to levels around per cent consistent with price stability in the second half of the forecast period. The Council expects the inflation rate on average to remain around zero per cent before rising gradually to levels around the mediumterm target in the course of next year. The dynamics of consumer price inflation have continued to be historically low in recent months. Low inflation in external markets favourable developments in commodity prices and imported inflation subdued domestic demand the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered energy prices have all contributed to the low inflation environment. At the forecast horizon the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a declining extent as domestic demand recovers gradually. As a result of improvements in productivity and moderate wage growth alongside economic growth low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period despite the pickup in domestic demand. Low inflation environment for a prolonged period is likely to lead to a persistent reduction in expectations which is expected to help anchor inflation expectations playing a key role in determining the nominal path of the economy around the Banks mediumterm inflation target. In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to continue despite slightly weaker external demand. The recovery in the real economy has continued over the past quarter with output rising across a wide range of sectors as employment continued to grow. The protracted recovery in Hungarys external markets and the economic sanctions imposed due to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia have resulted in a slightly weaker external demand environment however economic growth is expected to continue reflecting the pickup in domestic demand. The improvement in the outlook for activity the effect of the Funding for Growth Scheme the easing in credit constraints and the increasing use of EU funding are expected to support investment growth. As seen in previous quarters the gradual improvement in employment and rising household real income due to low inflation are playing a key role in the recovery in household consumption. As a result of the legislative process affecting household loans household net financial wealth is expected to increase accelerating the deleveraging process. However the recovery in consumption is likely to remain moderate due the slow fall in precautionary motives following the crisis. The decision is expected to contribute to an increase in household income but the saving rate is likely to remain above precrisis levels due to the slow fall in precautionary motives. Looking ahead Hungarian economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously. Hungarys financing capacity remains high and external debt is falling. The external position of the economy continued to improve in the first half of as reflected in the decline in external debt ratios. The trade surplus while remaining substantial in the coming years even as imports continue to rise due to increasing consumption and investment is likely to keep the current account surplus high over the coming years. The slight decline in the income balance deficit is expected to contribute to Hungarys external position remaining strong. The external financing capacity of the economy is likely to remain substantial as the use of EU transfers remains high despite the new budget cycle. Consistent with this the debt ratios key in terms of the countrys vulnerability are likely to continue to decline. The Hungarian risk premium has remained broadly unchanged in the past quarter and sentiment has been volatile in global financial markets. International investor sentiment has been volatile in the past quarter mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts uncertainty surrounding an interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve the interest rate reduction by the European Central Bank and its additional monetary policy measures. Of the domestic risk indicators the CDS spread and foreign currency bond spreads have not changed significantly since publication of the June Inflation Report. Longterm yields also remained around levels seen at the beginning of the quarter following a sharp rise due to temporary factors. The forint exchange rate has depreciated in the past quarter due in part to countryspecific reasons but mainly as a result of the changes in international investor sentiment. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. The Monetary Council considered three scenarios around the baseline projection in the September Report which if materialise might influence the future stance of monetary policy. In the alternative scenario assuming a weakerthanexpected recovery in Hungarys trading partner countries and consequently lower inflation the inflation target can be achieved with looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline scenario. In the risk scenario assuming an earlierthanexpected monetary policy tightening by globally influential central banks tighter domestic monetary conditions than suggested in the baseline projection can ensure that inflation moves in line with price stability in the medium term. A third scenario which assumes more robust growth in domestic employment and consumption and consequently stronger domestic activity growth and a faster increase in inflation relative to the baseline projection also implies a tighter monetary policy stance. In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish and with current monetary conditions maintained inflation is likely to move into line with the target over the medium term.

2014-10-28,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at .In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent.

With employment rising the unemployment rate continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period.Based on the inflation data for September consumer prices continue to show historically low dynamics. In addition to oneoff inflationreducing effects the Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting low inflation in external markets favourable developments in commodity prices and imported inflation the degree of unused capacity in the economy subdued wage dynamics the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered energy prices implemented in a series of steps.

However domestic demandside disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace and inflation is likely to reach levels around per cent consistent with price stability in the second half of the forecast period.In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. The decline in industrial production and foreign trade in August may have partly reflected oneoff effects. The growth rate of retail sales picked up further in August. In the Councils judgement economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution. The increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme are expected to sustain the recovery in investment. Household consumption is likely to grow gradually mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Based on labour market data for August the number of employees including those employed under public employment programmes was stagnant and the unemployment rate fell.International investor sentiment mostly deteriorated in the past month mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the weak outlook for activity. The majority of domestic risk measures were broadly unchanged.

However domestic demandside disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace and inflation is likely to reach levels around per cent consistent with price stability in the second half of the forecast period.In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. The decline in industrial production in August was partly reversed in September and the trade surplus rose again following the decline in the previous month. According to the preliminary data the dynamics of retail sales were stable in September. In the Councils judgement economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution to growth. The increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Banks Funding for Growth Scheme are expected to sustain the recovery in investment. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Employment increased in the third quarter with a significant contribution from the rise in the number of those employed under public employment programmes.International investor sentiment has been mostly positive in the past month mainly reflecting the release of buoyant macroeconomic data in the US monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and the continued decline in the world market price of crude oil. Domestic risk measures improved slightly. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment.In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term.

Magyar Nemzeti Bank Monetary Council,119,2014
2014-12-16,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Monetary Councils judgement persistently loose monetary conditions are consistent with the achievement of price stability. In the Councils judgement with the easing cycle completed maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period is warranted by the mediumterm achievement of the Banks inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. Global economic growth continues at a moderate pace. The low inflation environment is likely to persist for a sustained period. Significant differences remain across the individual regions in terms of economic growth. The recovery in the euroarea economy has been slow and fragile while strong growth in the US is likely to continue looking ahead. Growth has been slowing in the larger emerging market economies. Global inflation remains moderate in line with the decline in commodity prices particularly the sharp drop in crude oil prices and weak demand and inflationary pressure in the global economy is likely to remain moderate for a sustained period looking ahead. There have been differences in the monetary policy stance of globally influential central banks in recent months however monetary conditions remain loose overall and consequently global interest rate and liquidity conditions continue to be supportive. Inflation in Hungary is likely to be significantly below the inflation target next year and rise to levels around per cent only in the second half of the forecast period. The Council expects inflation to be significantly below the inflation target next year and rise to levels around per cent in the second half of the forecast period. In recent months inflation has been lower than the projection in the September issue of the Inflation Report mainly on account of the sharp decline in commodity prices the low food prices and weak demand. In the first half of the forecast period domestic inflation is likely to be substantially below the target mainly reflecting cost shocks having downside effects on inflation as well as the weak demand and inflation environment in Hungarys major trading partner countries. In the second half of the forecast period inflation is likely to move in line with the inflation target reflecting the recovery in activity and the increase in wage dynamics as the effects of cost shocks fade away. Inflation expectations anchored around the target are likely to ensure that price and wagesetting will be consistent with the inflation target. In the Councils judgement domestic economic growth may continue in a balanced pattern. The recovery in the real economy has continued over the past quarter with output rising across most sectors on an annual basis. At the forecast horizon domestic demand is expected to make the largest contribution to growth. Subdued global activity and the slowdown in the euro area economy are likely to act as a drag on export growth in however the contribution of net exports to growth is likely to increase in the second half of the forecast period. The extended and prolonged Funding for Growth Scheme is likely to promote corporate investment next year but weak global economic activity abroad and lower receipts of EU funding are likely to work in the opposite direction. Households investment activity is expected to rise gradually from its historically low level. As seen in previous quarters the gradual improvement in employment and rising household real income due to low inflation are likely to play a key role in the recovery in household consumption. The uniformity decision of the Curia concerning household loans will effectively contribute to the reduction of existing debts thus household net financial wealth is expected to increase accelerating the deleveraging process. The conversion of foreign currency loans into forint is expected to reduce uncertainty surrounding households future income and wealth position thereby strengthening consumer confidence and supporting the recovery in consumption and domestic demand. Hungarys financing capacity remains high and external debt is falling. The external position of the economy amounted to nearly per cent of GDP in the second quarter of. Over the coming year the trade surplus is expected to rise despite the increase of imports driven by the pickup in consumption and investment reflecting the improvement in the terms of trade and from the recovery in external demand. The surplus on the transfer account is likely to fall from its historical high as the budget cycle of European Union funding ends. As a result of the two offsetting effects Hungarys current account surplus and external financing capacity are likely to stabilise at a high level in the coming years. Consistent with this the countrys external debt ratios key in terms of the countrys vulnerability are likely to continue to decline. The Banks selffinancing programme the conversion of foreign currency loans into forint and the provision of foreign currency funding by the Bank related to conversions will contribute positively to the change in gross debt. The Hungarian risk premium has fallen in the past quarter and sentiment has been generally favourable in global financial markets. International investor sentiment has been generally favourable in the past quarter. Global risk appetite fell in the middle of October but sentiment in financial markets began to improve from the end of the month. The positive turnaround in sentiment reflected the release of favourable macroeconomic data in the US the launch of the ECBs asset purchase programme monetary easing by the Bank of Japan the reduction in interest rates in China and the continued decline in crude oil prices. Of the domestic risk indicators the CDS spread has been broadly unchanged over the past quarter and foreign currency bond spreads have fallen. Longterm yields on forintdenominated bonds have declined significantly in the period since publication of the September Inflation Report. The forint has appreciated against the euro in the past quarter due mainly to countryspecific factors. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. Downside risks to inflation increased. Overall downside risks to inflation increased relative to the September Report projection. The Monetary Council considered three alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the December Report which if materialise might influence significantly the future conduct of monetary policy. In the alternative scenario assuming persistently lower oil prices the decline in the price of oil is mainly driven by supplyside factors. The lower inflation environment points in the direction of looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline scenario and economic growth may be stronger. The alternative scenario assuming persistently weak external demand implies downside risks to growth and inflation and therefore looser monetary conditions ensure the achievement of the inflation target. The intensification of geopolitical tensions associated with a decline in external demand could lead to a sudden sharp rise in the risk premium. As a result exchange rate depreciation might raise inflationary pressure and therefore a tighter monetary policy stance might ensure that the inflation target is met at the forecast horizon. In the Councils judgement there is a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish. With current monetary conditions maintained inflation is likely to move into line with the target in the second half of the forecast period despite disinflationary trends in external markets. The Council judges that based on available information the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold achieving the mediumterm inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period.,120,2014
2015-01-27,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pickup in the components of domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising the unemployment rate continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for December consumer prices show historically low dynamics. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets moderated path of commodity prices and imported inflation the degree of unused capacity in the economy subdued wage dynamics and the moderation in inflation expectations. The continued decline in oil prices and the fall in processed food prices have contributed to the further easing in inflation. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However domestic demandside disinflationary pressures are likely to weaken significantly in the second half of the forecast period as activity gathers pace and inflation is likely to reach levels around per cent consistent with price stability in the latter half of the forecast period. In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. Industrial output continued to grow and the trade surplus rose. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable or increasing slightly in recent months. Looking ahead domestic demand is likely to be the main engine of growth. The prolonged Funding for Growth Scheme is likely to promote corporate investment this year but weak global economic activity and lower receipts of EU funding are likely to work in the opposite direction. Household consumption is also likely to pick up gradually mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. According to seasonally adjusted data employment was broadly unchanged in November with the increase in the number of those employed under public employment programmes also playing a role. International investor sentiment has been volatile since the Councils latest interest rate decision with risk aversion dominating financial markets. Global sentiment deteriorated significantly at the end of the year due to the turbulence in Russian financial markets and the political events in Greece. Then following a temporary improvement global risk appetite fell again from the middle of the month reflecting the further decline in oil prices and the surprise announcement by the Swiss National Bank. The European Central Bank has decided to extend its asset purchase programme aiming to bring euroarea inflation into line with the inflation target corresponding to price stability. International factors were a major factor behind movements in the forint exchange rate. Domestic risk measures were little changed as the temporary effects of the financial market turbulence at the end of the year dissipated. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. The Swiss franc has appreciated significantly against the forint and other currencies after the Swiss National Bank announced that it had abandoned the francs peg against the euro. The exchange rate at which Hungarian foreign currencydenominated household mortgage loans would be converted into forints was fixed in advance in November. In agreement with the MNBs proposal the conversion was effected in a single step for all households with foreign currencydenominated household mortgage loans. The MNB provided nearly EUR billion liquidity required for settlements and forint conversions thereby allowing time for participants of the domestic financial system to manage exchange rate risk. Therefore the appreciation of the Swiss franc may affect the domestic banking sector mainly through losses incurred on Swiss francdenominated corporate loans and household loans unaffected by the conversion. That however is expected to have a moderate impact and is not to pose systemic stability risk. In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish. Based on data available since the latest policy decision there has been a shift towards the alternative scenario implying looser monetary policy published in the December Inflation Report. With current monetary conditions maintained there have been no secondround effects despite disinflationary trends in external markets and therefore inflation is likely to move into line with the target in the second half of the forecast horizon. The Council judges that based on available information the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold achieving the mediumterm inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period.

2015-02-24,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pickup in the components of domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising the unemployment rate continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for January consumer prices show historically low dynamics. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the mediumterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets the moderate path of commodity prices and imported inflation the degree of unused capacity in the economy and the moderation in inflation expectations. The continued decline in oil prices and the fall in market services prices have contributed to the further easing in inflation and core inflation respectively. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. Based on the low market services price index the probability of secondround effects may have increased. However domestic demandside disinflationary pressures are likely to weaken significantly in the second half of the forecast period as activity gathers pace and inflation is likely to reach levels around per cent consistent with price stability in the latter half of the forecast period accompanied by an increase in downside risks. In the Councils judgement economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. According to the preliminary data release Hungarys gross domestic product grew in the fourth quarter of relative to both the same period a year earlier and the previous quarter. Industrial production fell relative to the previous quarter while the trade surplus remained stable. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable and increased slightly in recent months with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Looking ahead domestic demand is likely to be the main engine of growth. The extended Funding for Growth Scheme is likely to promote corporate investment this year but weak global economic activity and lower receipts of EU funding are likely to work in the opposite direction. Household consumption is also likely to pick up gradually mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. According to seasonally adjusted data employment was broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of relative to the previous period with the increase in the number of those employed under public employment programmes also playing a role. International investor sentiment has been volatile since the Councils latest interest rate decision. The political events in Greece and the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia had a negative impact on global sentiment. But the correction in the path of world oil prices since January and the announcement on the extension of the European Central Banks asset purchase programme at the end of January and then the results of the negotiations to settle the conflict between Ukraine and Russia resulted in an improvement in financial market sentiment. The forint appreciated against the euro mainly reflecting international factors. Developments in domestic risk measures were mixed with the CDS spread falling significantly since the latest policy decision and longterm government bond yields rising slightly. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils view a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Councils judgement there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish. Based on data available since the latest policy decision there has been a further shift towards the alternative scenario implying looser monetary policy published in the December Inflation Report and the probability of secondround effects taking hold in the wake of disinflationary trends in the economy as well as a change in inflation expectations has increased. However the Council judges that based on available information the current level of the central bank base rate yet remains consistent with the mediumterm achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold achieving the inflation target points in the direction of loose monetary conditions for an extended period. The Monetary Council will consider the need for possible further easing of monetary conditions in view of the March Inflation Report projection after a comprehensive assessment of the mediumterm outlook for inflation. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .,122,2015
2015-03-24,After a scheduled review of the Banks inflation target the Monetary Council decided to improve the flexibility of the inflation targeting regime. As a result the Council designated a ± percentage point tolerance band while maintaining the inflation target defined as a per cent rate of increase in the domestic Consumer Price Index published by the Central Statistical Office. In line with past practice the MNB will publish an assessment of performance in meeting the inflation target each year in the Annual Report. The primary statutory objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank is to achieve and maintain price stability. Since the framework for meeting the Banks statutory objective has been the inflation targeting regime. The MNB can contribute to sustainable economic growth by achieving and maintaining price stability. The conditions for price stability are assumed to hold if economic agents can reasonably expect inflation to remain low and stable looking ahead over a longer period. Price stability does not necessarily mean inflation around zero persistently and excessively low inflation or negative inflation may have risks to economic activity as well. A ± per cent target is low enough to ensure that economic losses arising from inflation remain moderate takes into account potential statistical distortions stemming from the method of calculating the Consumer Price Index and may adequately mitigate the risk of deflation. At the same time it also takes into account the fact that growth in emerging economies is associated with the catchup with developed countries in terms of prices which may cause additional inflation relative to developed countries. The financial crisis has posed new challenges to monetary policy all around the world. The crisis highlighted that the shocks to the economy may be much greater than previously thought and the probability of monetary policy being faced with constraints will not be negligible in the future. Under the inflation targeting regime central banks have moved towards greater flexibility and reformed their monetary policy instruments. While maintaining the primary objective of price stability flexible inflation targeting provides a framework where the central bank not only focuses on inflation in the short run but it also takes into account other real economic and financial stability factors. Primarily real economic factors are taken into account in decisionmaking in a way that the central bank is willing to tolerate deviations of consumer prices from the inflation target temporarily in order to avoid excessive volatility of real variables. A ± percentage point tolerance band around the inflation target may contribute to increasing the flexibility of the framework. The use of a tolerance band is consistent with international best practice followed by central banks. The Bank continues to aim at achieving per cent inflation however the ± percentage point tolerance band recognises that inflation may fluctuate around that level as an effect of shocks hitting the economy. The time horizon relevant for the Monetary Council continues to be to quarters. The Governments economic policy may contribute to achieving and maintaining price stability through several channels. Keeping the government deficit at a stable and low level and further reducing debt tax measures and changing administered prices in line with the ± inflation target help reduce the real economic costs of achieving and maintaining price stability. The Council will review the new inflation target after years at the latest or at the time of entry into the ERM exchange rate regime by Hungary.,123,2015
2015-04-21,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from April. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pickup in the components of domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising the unemployment continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for March consumer prices show historically low dynamics however the rate of decline in prices slowed. The March inflation data was consistent with the projection in the March issue of the Inflation Report but was slightly higher than market expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the shortterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets subdued imported inflation the degree of unused capacity in the economy and the moderation in inflation expectations. The rise in fuel prices was the main factor influencing inflation developments while core inflation was broadly unchanged relative to the previous month. With the pickup in domestic demand and owing to the increase in wages core inflation is likely to rise gradually however this process may slow due to the secondround effects of low commodity prices. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. Overall more moderate underlying inflation developments point in the direction of a low inflation environment and therefore inflation is expected to approach levels around per cent towards the end of the forecast period. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. Robust growth has been supported by both domestic and external demand. The volume of industrial production grew further but fell relative to the previous month. The trade surplus was stable. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable and increased slightly in recent months with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Rising household real income as a result of low inflation the reduced need for deleveraging and increasing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually owing to the recovery in activity the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Employment was broadly unchanged in February. On the whole international investor sentiment has been favourable in the period since the Councils latest interest rate decision. Increased uncertainty surrounding Greece mixed incoming macroeconomic data from the US the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East adversely affected international investor sentiment while positive macroeconomic news from the euro area contributed to an improvement in financial markets. With small fluctuations the forint appreciated against the euro followed by a slight correction at the end of period. Domestic risk measures and longterm government bond yields rose slightly in the period since the latest policy decision. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils judgement there is a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for a sustained period. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on data becoming available previously the risk of secondround effects taking hold in the wake of the change in inflation expectations still remains after increasing in recent months. In the Councils judgement if the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the economy point in the direction of a reduction in the policy rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Cautious easing of the policy rate may continue as long as it supports the achievement of the mediumterm inflation target. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May .,124,2015
2015-05-26,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from May. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pickup in the components of domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising unemployment continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for April consumer prices show historically low dynamics however the rate of decline in prices slowed further. The April inflation data was slightly higher than both the projection in the March issue of the Inflation Report and market expectations however the Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the shortterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets subdued imported inflation the degree of unused capacity in the economy and the moderation in inflation expectations. Rises in fuel prices as well as in the price indices for market services and unprocessed food were the main factors contributing to the increase in inflation. Core inflation was up slightly compared to the previous month. With the pickup in domestic demand and owing to the increase in wages core inflation is likely to rise gradually however this process may slow due to the secondround effects of low commodity prices. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. Overall moderate underlying inflation developments continue to point in the direction of a low inflation environment and therefore inflation is expected to approach levels around per cent towards the end of the forecast period. In the Councils judgement Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. Robust growth has been supported by both domestic and external demand. This is underpinned by the preliminary GDP data for the first quarter of which showed that the Hungarian economy continued to grow dynamically mainly driven by the performance of industry and the expansion in retail sales. On the expenditure side domestic demand growth may have continued. According to preliminary data the trade surplus was higher in March than a year previously. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable and increased slightly in recent months with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Rising household real income as a result of low inflation the reduced need for deleveraging and increasing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually owing to the recovery in activity the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Employment grew further in the first quarter as activity picked up. International investor sentiment has been mostly unfavourable in the period since the Councils latest interest rate decision. The downgrade of Greek government debt as well as tensions surrounding its financing and weak incoming macroeconomic data from the US negatively affected international investor sentiment. In addition the reduction in risks associated with deflation in the euroarea economy may also have contributed to rises in longterm yields in developed and emerging markets. Accompanied by noticeable fluctuations the forint depreciated against the euro mainly driven by international factors. The domestic CDS spread has remained broadly unchanged while longterm government bond yields have risen in line with rising euro area yields in the period since the latest policy decision. Hungarys persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils judgement a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils judgement there is a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for a sustained period. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually.

In the Councils judgement if the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the economy point in the direction of a reduction in the policy rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Cautious easing of the policy rate may continue as long as it supports the achievement of the mediumterm inflation target.

2015-06-23,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from June. THE MONETARY COUNCILS STATEMENT ON MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND ITS MONETARY POLICY ASSESSMENT In the Monetary Councils assessment persistently loose monetary conditions are consistent with the achievement of price stability. In the Councils assessment the mediumterm achievement of the Banks inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy point in the direction of maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period. In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. The performance of the global economy has continued to be subdued in recent months. Inflation rates around the world remain at low levels. Significant differences remain across the individual regions in terms of economic growth. Of the worlds developed regions growth in the euro area picked up slightly on the preliminary estimate in the first quarter of broadly in line with expectations. By contrast the US economy contracted relative to the previous quarter. Growth has been stable or slowing in most of the major emerging market economies. Global inflation remains moderate reflecting low crude oil prices and subdued demand and inflationary pressure in the global economy is likely to remain moderate looking ahead. The monetary policy stance of globally influential central banks points to the direction of persistently loose monetary conditions the ECB has continued its quantitative easing policy within the framework of its extended asset purchase programme the Bank of Japan has maintained the pace of its asset purchases and the Federal Reserve is likely to finetune the appropriate timing and magnitude of its interest rate increase likely being postponed to a later date. Monetary conditions remain loose overall and consequently global interest rate and liquidity conditions continue to be supportive. In the Councils assessment inflation is likely to be below the inflation target this year and next and is expected to rise to levels around per cent only towards the end of the forecast period. The Council expects inflation to be significantly below the inflation target over the short term. Data available in recent months were slightly higher than the projection in the March issue of the Inflation Report mainly reflecting higherthanexpected fuel prices. Inflation has departed from its historical low in recent months and is likely to remain in positive territory looking ahead. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as the effects of the lowcost environment fade domestic demand picks up and wages increase. However inflation is expected to approach levels around the per cent target towards the end of the forecast period reflecting moderate underlying inflation. The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target is likely to ensure that price and wagesetting will be consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as domestic demand growth strengthens. Domestic economic growth is likely to continue to be robust supported by rising external demand in addition to growing domestic demand. Growth in the domestic economy has continued over recent period. In the coming years domestic demand is likely to remain the main driver of growth however rising exports reflecting strengthening growth in Hungarys export markets are also expected to support domestic economic growth. The low inflation environment and the improvement in the labour market will contribute to household real income growth which in turn is expected to facilitate household consumption. The conversion of foreign currency loans will reduce the household sectors vulnerability which may facilitate the gradual easing of consumers precaution. In addition to the general improvement in economic activity the Funding for Growth Scheme also supports private sector investment. Household investment activity is expected to strengthen at the forecast horizon due to the pickup in the housing market and the extension of the housing subsidy system. Export growth is likely to be strong reflecting higher growth in Hungarys export markets. The negative output gap is expected to close at the end of the forecast period and therefore the real economic environment is likely to continue to have a disinflationary impact in the coming quarters. The economys external vulnerability continues to decrease. Hungarys external financing capacity continued to increase in the fourth quarter of. Based on the fourquarter values the trade surplus rose again with domestic agents using a significant amount of EU transfers also in the final quarter. Looking at the structure of external financing the outflow of debt liabilities continued in and consequently the decline in Hungarys debt ratios as well. Nondebt liabilities have increased overall. Looking ahead the external financing capacity is expected to remain robust exceeding per cent of GDP in. Net exports are expected to rise further reflecting the expected improvement in external demand and the positive impact on the terms of trade of the decline in oil prices. Transfers from the EU will presumably be lower in. The expected stabilisation of the deficit on the income balance is likely to reflect the combined effect of the decline in interest expenses and rising profits of foreignowned companies in addition to a falling debt path. The continued very high net lending is likely to contribute to a gradual decline in the countrys external debt ratios. Sentiment in international financial markets was volatile but rather unfavourable. In April the positive effect of strong macroeconomic data from the euro area offset the negative effect of political events in Greece mixed macroeconomic data form the US and geopolitical tensions. However global investor sentiment deteriorated throughout the latter greater part of the period reflecting the downgrade of Greek sovereign debt and the postponement of debt repayments as well as weak macroeconomic data from the US economy. Of the domestic risk indicators the CDS spread has increased slightly and longterm yields on forintdenominated bonds have risen significantly in the period since publication of the March Report in line with international trends. The forint has depreciated against the euro in the past quarter due mainly to international factors. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. The Monetary Council considered three alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the June Report which might influence significantly the future conduct of monetary policy. The rise in yields in developed markets may lead to an increase in the risk premium on developing markets and therefore the inflation target can be achieved with tighter monetary policy than assumed in the baseline projection. Mounting geopolitical tensions may involve a protracted decline in external demand and a sudden sharp increase in the risk premium and therefore tighter monetary policy than assumed in the baseline projection ensures the achievement of the inflation target at the forecast horizon as well. On the other hand the alternative scenario assuming persistently low cost environment and increasing secondround effects may lead to lower inflation and stronger economic growth which may justify even looser monetary conditions than the baseline projection. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on available data the risk of secondround effects materialising due to excessively low inflation expectations has moderated. In view of the June Inflation Report projections following a comprehensive assessment of the mediumterm outlook for inflation the Council assesses that the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target points to the direction of further slight easing of the policy rate. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July,126,2015
2015-07-21,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from July. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economic environment is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pickup in domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising unemployment continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Consumer prices continued to show low dynamics in June rising slightly compared with both the previous month and the same period a year earlier. The inflation data received was consistent with both the projection in the June Inflation Report and market expectations. Core inflation was unchanged relative to May. The Banks measures of underlying inflation capturing the shortterm outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets the low level of imported inflation and the degree of unused capacity in the economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as the effects of the lowcost environment fade domestic demand picks up and wages increase. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and the low inflation environment is likely to persist. Consequently inflation is expected toapproach levels around the per cent target only towards the end of the forecast horizon reflecting moderate underlying inflation. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. Robust growth has been supported by both domestic and external demand. On the expenditure side domestic demand growth may have continued. In May the trade surplus was significantly higher than its level a year previously. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable in recent months with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Based on data for May industrial production expanded somewhat less dynamically relative to the same period a year earlier than in previous months. Rising household real income underpinned by low inflation the reduced need for deleveraging and growing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually owing to the recovery in activity the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Unemployment fell in May as the activity rate remained unchanged. Overall international investor sentiment has been unfavourable in the period since the Councils latest policy decision. The various indicators of risk rose and the major equity indices fell. Tensions surrounding the financing of Greek government debt and the countrys potential exit from the euro area as well as concerns about the disturbances in Chinese capital markets had a negative impact on global investor sentiment in the first part of the period. However in the latter half of the period global appetite for risk improved. Accompanied by noticeable fluctuations the forint depreciated against the euro driven by international factors before appreciating considerably as investor sentiment improved. The domestic CDS spread has remained broadly unchanged and longterm government bond yields have fallen since the previous policy decision. Persistently high external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on available data the risk of secondround effects materialising due to excessively low inflation expectations has moderated. In the Councils assessment the policy rate has reached the level which ensures the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the economy point to the direction of loose monetary conditions for an extended period.

2015-08-25,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening output remains below potential and the domestic real economic environment is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pickup in domestic demand capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungarys export markets. With employment rising unemployment continues to exceed its longterm level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. Consumer prices continued to show low dynamics in July rising slightly compared with the same period a year earlier. The incoming inflation data was consistent with the projection in the June Inflation Report. Annual core inflation was unchanged relative to previous months. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy reflecting subdued imported inflation falling commodity prices and the degree of unused capacity in the economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as domestic demand picks up however the continuing decline in commodity prices may moderate the increase in the consumer price index. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact. Consequently inflation is expected to approach levels around the per cent target only towards the end of the forecast horizon reflecting moderate underlying inflation. According to the preliminary estimate domestic economic growth continued in the second quarter. Growth was slightly slower than projected in the June Inflation Report presumably as a result of the weaker agricultural output. The Council assesses that based on the monthly macroeconomic indicators underlying growth has not changed significantly and economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. In June industrial production rose relative to the previous month and the same period a year earlier. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable in recent months with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Rising household real income underpinned by low inflation the reduced need for deleveraging and growing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually owing to the recovery in activity as well as the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Employment continued to grow with the unemployment rate falling below per cent in the second quarter. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils latest policy decision but this has had little impact on domestic financial market indicators. Developments at the negotiations on the settlement of Greek government debt led to an improvement in sentiment. By contrast global risk appetite deteriorated reflecting uncertainty about Chinese capital market developments and the countrys growth outlook as well as an impending interest rate increase by the US Fed. Domestic financial markets have been calm with the forint fluctuating against the euro within a narrow range. The domestic CDS spread and longterm government bond yields have been broadly unchanged since the previous policy decision. The persistently high external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The negative output gap is expected to close only gradually over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on September .,128,2015
2015-09-22,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. The Monetary Councils statement on macroeconomic developments and its monetary policy assessment The threemonth fixedrate central bank deposit will be the Magyar Nemzeti Banks main policy instrument from September replacing the twoweek deposit facility. Consequently on its meeting of September the Monetary Council has made its policy decision on the interest rate on this facility. The threemonth deposit facility will be available without limit the maturity of the policy interest rate will be extended from two weeks to three months. The twoweek central bank deposit will remain part of the Banks instruments however the facility will be offered at auctions with quantity limits. Quantitative limits will be placed on the stock of twoweek deposits first on September. Thereafter the stock of deposits will fall gradually to the HUF billion limit set by the end of the year. In the Monetary Councils assessment persistently loose monetary conditions are consistent with the achievement of price stability. In the Councils assessment the mediumterm achievement of the Banks inflation target and a corresponding support to the real economy point in the direction of maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period. In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. The performance of the global economy has continued to be subdued in recent months. Inflation around the world remains at low levels. Significant differences remain across the individual regions in terms of economic growth. Of the worlds developed regions growth in the euro area picked up slightly in the second quarter of. The US economy grew strongly in the period. Most major emerging market economies are decelerating. Reflecting low crude oil and commodity prices as well as subdued demand environment global inflation trends and inflationary pressure in the global economy are likely to remain moderate looking ahead. The monetary policy stance of globally influential central banks remained unchanged although continues to be different in recent months the ECB and the Bank of Japan continued their asset purchase programmes while the US Fed was preparing for the appropriate timing and magnitude of its interest rate increase postponed to a later date than the market had expected. Monetary conditions remain loose overall and consequently global interest rate and liquidity conditions continue to be supportive. In the Councils assessment inflation is likely to be below the inflation target this year and next and is expected to rise to levels around per cent only in the second half of. The Council expects inflation to be significantly below the inflation target over the short term. According to data becoming available in recent months the underlying trends were in line overall with the projection in the June issue of the Inflation Report. The difference between the projection and the actual outcome for the consumer price index was mainly accounted for lower fuel prices. Inflation is likely to develop firmly into positive territory towards the end of the year. Core inflation is likely to pick up gradually as costs increase continuingly and slowly from low levels and as a result of an expansion in domestic demand and rises in wages. However the horizon over which the inflation target is expected to be achieved has been extended by around two quarters relative to the previous projection due to the persistently low cost environment and slightly lower underlying inflation looking ahead and therefore inflation is expected to rise to levels around per cent only in the second half of. The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target is likely to support that price and wagesetting will be consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as domestic demand growth strengthens. Domestic economic growth is likely to continue supported by a gradual rise in both external and domestic demand. Growth in the domestic economy has continued over recent period. Domestic demand is likely to make an increasing contribution to growth. Rising exports reflecting growth in Hungarys export markets are also expected to support domestic economic growth. The improvement in the labour market and the low inflation environment contribute to household real income growth which in turn is expected to facilitate the expansion in household consumption. The conversion of foreign currency loans reduces the household sectors vulnerability which may support the gradual easing of consumers precaution. Household investment activity is expected to strengthen over the forecast horizon due to the pickup in the housing market and the extension of the housing subsidy system. Lower transfers from the EU are likely to have an opposite effect on growth. Economic growth is expected to slow in early as EU transfers decline however economic performance is expected to improve from the second half of next year supported by the improvement in lending activity and the resumption in EU funding. The negative output gap is expected to close at the end of the forecast horizon and therefore it is likely to continue to have a disinflationary impact in the coming quarters. The economys external vulnerability may continue to decrease. Hungarys external financing capacity increased further in early with the surpluses on foreign trade and the transfer balance continuing to be the major contributing factors. Looking at the structure of external financing the outflow of debt liabilities continued the effect of which was mitigated by a fall in interest rates and exchange rate revaluation due to the appreciation of the US dollar. As a result the countrys external debt ratios remained broadly unchanged. Hungarys external financing capacity is likely to remain strong over the forecast horizon exceeding per cent of GDP this year. Net exports are expected to rise further in reflecting the positive impact on the terms of trade of the decline in oil prices and the favourable external demand. In the external financing capacity is likely to remain high but is expected to fall slightly due to lower transfers from the EU. The deficit on the income balance is likely to stabilise reflecting the effect of the decline in interest expenses in addition to a declining debt trajectory and rising profits of companies as economic growth continues. In addition to the continuing very high level of net lending the Banks selffinancing programme and the conversion into forint of foreign currency loans are also likely to contribute to a further decline in the countrys external debt ratios. Sentiment in international financial markets was volatile but unfavourable overall. During the period developments related to Greek government debt problems concerns over growth in emerging economies and China disturbances in Chinese capital markets and uncertainty about the interest rate increase by the US Fed were the main factors contributing to the negative investor sentiment. Of the domestic measures of risk the CDS spread has risen slightly while longterm forint bond yields have fallen since the publication of the June Inflation Report. The forint has remained broadly unchanged against the euro in the past quarter. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. The Monetary Council considered two alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the September Inflation Report which might influence significantly the future conduct of monetary policy. In the first alternative scenario the persistently low cost environment and strengthening secondround effects pose an upside risk on economic growth and a downside risk on inflation. Consequently the inflation target can be achieved with looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline projection. In the second alternative scenario financial market turbulence leads to a sudden sharp increase in the risk premium and a decline in external demand. For this alternative scenario tighter monetary policy than assumed in the baseline projection ensures the achievement of the inflation target at the forecast horizon. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The negative output gap is expected to close only gradually over the policy horizon. In view of the projection in the September Inflation Report the Monetary Council assesses that the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period over a longer horizon than expected are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy.,129,2015
2015-10-20,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantially below the Banks target. Consumer prices fell in September. Core inflation was broadly unchanged. The Banks measures of underlying inflation indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as a result of an expansion in domestic demand and rises in wages but the persistently low cost environment contains the increase in consumer prices. The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target is likely to support that price and wagesetting will be consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as the output gap closes. Inflation is expected to move to positive territory in the coming months but to remain substantially below the per cent target and is only likely to rise to levels around per cent at the end of the forecast horizon. Domestic economic growth continued in the second quarter of. Based on the monthly macroeconomic indicators underlying growth did not change significantly. Industrial production rose in August relative to a year earlier. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable in recent months with their volume increasing across a wide range of products. Employment rose further while the unemployment rate was unchanged as activity increased. Domestic demand is making an increasing contribution to economic growth. Government investment is likely to fall as funding from the EU declines considerably the impact of which is expected to be mitigated by the gradual pickup in private sector investment. Domestic economic growth is likely to continue in line with the latest Inflation Report projection. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile over the period since the Councils latest policy decision but this has had little impact on domestic indicators. During the first half of the period uncertainty about the interest rate increase by the Fed and concerns over growth prospects in emerging economies had a negative impact on global appetite for risk. Global financial market environment improved in the second half of the period as market expectations of the Feds interest rate increase were postponed. Hungarian financial markets were relatively calm in the period with the forint appreciating slightly against the euro. The domestic CDS spread and longterm government bond yields have decreased since the previous policy decision. Market expectations have moved in line with the Banks forward guidance announced in September and are consistent with maintaining the base rate unchanged over the entire forecast horizon. Hungarys persistently strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate while the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period over the entire forecast horizon are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on November .,130,2015
2015-11-17,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantially below the Banks target. The annual consumer price index and core inflation both rose in October. As a result inflation returned into positive territory. The Banks measures of underlying inflation indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as a result of an expansion in domestic demand and rises in wages but the persistently low cost environment contains the increase in the consumer price index. The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target is likely to contribute to price and wagesetting being consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as the output gap closes. Inflation is expected to remain substantially below the per cent target over the coming months and is only likely to rise to levels around per cent at the end of the forecast horizon. Based on preliminary GDP data Hungarian economic growth continued in the third quarter of at a lower rate than expected. Due to a slowdown in external demand industrial production weakened slightly in the third quarter relative to the previous period which may have contributed to the slowdown in economic growth. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable in recent months with their volume increasing across a wide range of products. Employment rose further while the unemployment rate fell. Domestic demand is making an increasing contribution to economic growth. Government investment is likely to fall as funding from the EU declines considerably the impact of which is expected to be offset by the gradual pickup in private sector investment and the Banks Growth Supporting Programme. The latter also helps to restore marketbased financing and achieve a lasting turnaround in lending over the longer term. Overall sentiment in global financial markets has been mixed over the period since the Councils latest policy decision. During the period the main factors affecting global appetite for risk were the ECBs communication suggesting that it would adopt a looser monetary policy stance looking forward continued uncertainty about the interest rate increase by the Fed and concerns over growth prospects in emerging economies. Conditions in Hungarian financial markets were characterised by increased volatility with the forint depreciating slightly against the euro. The domestic CDS spread and longterm government bond yields have been broadly unchanged since the previous policy decision. Market yield expectations moved in line with the Banks guidance that the central bank base rate would be held constant over an extended period. The targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank also facilitate a decline in longterm yields and consequently a loosening of monetary conditions. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are likely to decline even further as inflation rises. Hungarys persistently strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate while the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period over the entire forecast horizon are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy.

2015-12-15,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantially below the Banks target. The annual inflation rate increased slightly and core inflation was broadly unchanged in November. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. Core inflation has been rising gradually as a result of an expansion in household consumption and an acceleration in wage growth but the persistently low global inflationary environment contains the increase in the domestic consumer price index. Inflation expectations fell to a historic low. Inflation is expected to remain below the per cent target over the forecast period and is only likely to approach it by the end of the forecast horizon. Hungarian economic growth continued at a weakerthanexpected rate in the third quarter of. The decline in agricultural production and the moderation of industrial production dynamics were the main contributing factors to the deceleration. As in previous months retail sales were stable in October with their volume increasing across a wide range of products. Employment and unemployment were broadly unchanged. The deceleration in external demand and in funding from the EU will lead to a significant slowdown in growth in. Recovery is expected from the second half of mainly reflecting the strengthening performance of Hungarys export markets as well as the Banks and the Governments policy measures. In the Councils assessment the Banks Growth Supporting Programme and the recent steps taken by the Government to encourage home building are expected to dampen the slowdown in the rate of growth. In addition to these factors rising household consumption is likely to support the economic expansion in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile in the previous month deteriorating significantly during the last week. Over the period the main factors affecting appetite for risk were the ECBs communication suggesting that it would adopt a looser monetary policy stance and its policy decision continued uncertainty about an interest rate increase by the Fed and concerns over growth prospects in emerging economies. Conditions in Hungarian financial markets were mostly influenced by international factors. The forint exchange rate has weakened and Hungarys CDS spread has been broadly unchanged in the period since the previous policy decision. Hungarys persistently strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Market yield expectations were in line with the Banks forward guidance that the base rate would be held constant over an extended period. The unconventional targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank also facilitate a decline in longterm yields and consequently a loosening in monetary conditions. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment the reduction in unused capacity is stopping temporarily as economic growth slows and therefore the negative output gap will close only at the end of the policy horizon. Inflationary pressures remain moderate over a sustained period. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period over the entire forecast horizon are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. Under current conditions the Monetary Council wishes to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable way by holding the base rate unchanged for an extended period and by using unconventional targeted monetary policy instruments as these contribute efficiently to the further loosening in monetary conditions particularly to the decline in longterm yields. The Council examines thoroughly the range of potentially applicable tools. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks Monetary Council has decided that beginning from December it will issue shorterform press releases following its policy meetings in the months of publication of the Inflation Report in order to facilitate comparison of monthly press releases. The press releases will have the same format as those issued monthly between Inflation Reports. During the discussion of the decision the Council also considered the December Inflation Report. In parallel the Councils statements published previously in the Inflation Reports months will be transformed into an introductory chapter of the Inflation Report describing the Councils assessment of macroeconomic conditions entitled The Monetary Councils key findings which will be first published in the December Report on December. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on December .,132,2015
2016-01-26,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantially below the Banks target. The annual inflation rate increased while core inflation was unchanged in December. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. There has been a marked fall in oil prices recently. As a result inflation may be lower over the short term than earlier expected. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as a result of an expansion in household consumption and an acceleration in wage growth but the persistently low global inflationary environment contains the increase in the domestic consumer price index. Inflation expectations fell to a historic low. Inflation is expected to remain below the per cent target over the forecast period and is only likely to approach it by the end of the forecast horizon. In the third quarter of Hungarian economic growth continued at a weaker rate than in previous quarters. The decline in agricultural production and the moderation in industrial production dynamics were the main factors contributing to the deceleration. As in previous months retail sales growth was stable in November with their volume increasing across a wide range of products. Employment increased slightly and unemployment declined again after stagnating in the previous month. Slower growth in emerging markets and the deceleration in funding from the EU will lead to a slowdown in growth this year. A recovery is expected from the second half of mainly reflecting the strengthening performance of Hungarys export markets as well as the Banks and the Governments policy measures. In the Councils assessment the Banks Growth Supporting Programme and the recent steps taken by the Government to encourage home building are expected to dampen the slowdown in the rate of growth. In addition to these factors rising household consumption is likely to support the economic expansion in the coming years. Overall sentiment in global financial markets has deteriorated since the Councils latest policy decision. In the second part of December investor sentiment improved temporarily following the Feds interest rate decision. In January risk indicators rose significantly in certain emerging countries in response to unfavourable macroeconomic data from China the fall in the Chinese equity market and the significant drop in oil prices. At the end of the period the European Central Banks communications affected investor sentiment favourably. Domestic financial markets remained stable even in the deteriorating investor environment. The forint exchange rate has appreciated and the domestic risk indicators have been mixed in the period since the previous policy decision. Hungarys persistently strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Market yield expectations were in line with the Banks forward guidance that the base rate would be held constant over an extended period. The unconventional targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank also facilitate a decline in longterm yields and consequently a loosening in monetary conditions. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment the reduction in unused capacity is stopping temporarily as economic growth slows and therefore the negative output gap will close only at the end of the policy horizon. Inflationary pressures remain moderate over a sustained period. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period over the entire forecast horizon are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. With the gradual phasingout of the twoweek central bank deposit facility serving to ease monetary conditions and with the more active use of central bank interest rate swaps a set of instruments effectively supporting the monetary policy objectives will be developed. Longterm government securities yields fell after the announcement of Phase of the SelfFinancing Programme and are likely to continue declining as the announced measures are implemented. The Monetary Council constantly monitors whether the resulting looser monetary conditions ensure the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. In this context the Council closely examines developments in the foreign monetary environment particularly the measures of the European Central Bank. If the Monetary Council considers it necessary further monetary loosening will be implemented primarily using the existing unconventional tools. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on February .,133,2016
2016-02-23,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantially below the Banks target. The annual inflation rate was unchanged and core inflation has remained broadly the same in January. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. Inflation may be lower over the short term than earlier expected reflecting the effect of low oil prices. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as a result of an expansion in household consumption and an acceleration in wage growth but the persistently low global inflationary environment contains the increase in the domestic consumer price index. Inflation expectations fell to a historic low. Inflation is expected to remain below the per cent target over the forecast period and is only likely to approach it by the end of the forecast horizon. The Hungarian economy grew dynamically again in the fourth quarter of following a subdued pace in the previous quarter. By this the economy showed a growth rate of close to per cent in. Based on monthly production indicators robust growth was supported by the performance of industry and the expansion in retail sales. Industrys value added may have risen again in the fourth quarter the shortterm prospects of domestic industry are strong. Based on data for December retail sales growth was stable as in previous months with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Employment increased slightly and unemployment continued to decline. Slower growth in emerging markets and the deceleration in funding from the EU will lead to a slowdown in growth in the first half of this year. A recovery is expected from the second half of mainly reflecting the improving economic performance of Hungarys export markets as well as the Banks and the Governments policy measures. In the Councils assessment the Banks Growth Supporting Programme as well as the steps taken by the Government to encourage home building and to help the fast drawdown on EU transfers are necessary to maintain growth of around per cent. In addition to these factors rising household consumption is likely to support the economic expansion in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has deteriorated slightly since the Councils latest policy decision mainly driven by concerns about the outlook for growth the monetary policy stance of the worlds leading central banks and news coming from oil markets. Equity indices in developed and Asian countries fell sharply reflecting uncertainties about future developments in oil markets and as an effect of some weakerthanexpected macroeconomic data. Domestic financial markets remained stable even in the deteriorating investor environment. The forint exchange rate has been broadly unchanged and longterm government bond yields have overall been lower in the period since the previous policy decision. Hungarys persistently strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Market yield expectations were in line with the Banks forward guidance that the base rate would be held constant over an extended period. The unconventional targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank also facilitate a decline in longterm yields and consequently a loosening in monetary conditions. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment the reduction in unused capacity is stopping temporarily as economic growth slows in the first half of. The negative output gap will close only at the end of the policy horizon as a result of the reacceleration of growth. Inflationary pressures remain moderate over a sustained period. Based on available information the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period over the entire forecast horizon are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. Longterm government securities yields fell after the announcement of Phase of the SelfFinancing Programme and are likely to continue declining as the announced measures are implemented. The Monetary Council constantly monitors whether the resulting looser monetary conditions ensure the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. In this context the Council closely examines developments in the foreign monetary environment particularly the measures of the European Central Bank. The Monetary Council may ease monetary conditions further in view of the March Inflation Report. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on March .,134,2016
2016-03-22,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points from to with effect from March. In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. The path of inflation has shifted downwards significantly relative to the December projection and remains substantially below the Banks target. The annual inflation rate and core inflation both decreased in February relative to the previous month. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. Core inflation rises only gradually as a result of rising household consumption and moderate wage growth. The persistently low global inflationary environment contains the increase in the domestic consumer price inflation. Inflation expectations fell further and are at historically low levels. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only approaches it in the first half of. The Hungarian economy grew dynamically again in the fourth quarter of following subdued growth in the previous quarter. Over the year as a whole the economy grew at a rate close to per cent. Based on detailed data the expansion in services and industry continued to be the main driver of economic growth. The performance of industry weakened in January. According to January data retail sales grew less strongly than in previous months. The employment rate remained broadly unchanged and the unemployment rate fell again in January. The deceleration in funding inflows from the EU leads to a slowdown in growth but the Banks and the Governments policy measures continue to contribute to economic recovery. In the Councils assessment economic growth of around per cent can be maintained by the Banks Growth Supporting Programme and the steps taken by the Government to encourage home construction and to facilitate the faster drawdown of EU transfers. Rising incomes the pickup in lending and the gradual decline in precautionary motives contribute to a substantial expansion in consumption which in turn provides a considerable support for economic growth. Sentiment in global financial markets has improved slightly overall since the Councils latest policy decision mainly drivenby expectations and announcements related to the monetary policy stance of the worlds leading central banks and news coming from oil markets. In March monetary conditions in the euro area were eased further by the European Central Bank. The forint exchange rate has weakened and longterm government bond yields have fallen since the previous policy decision. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Market yield expectations were in line with the Banks forward guidance. The unconventional targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank also facilitate a decline in longterm yields and consequently an easing in monetary conditions. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures remain moderate for an extended period. The real economy has a disinflationary impact over the policy horizon. Based on the March Inflation Report projection the time when the inflation target is met has lengthened as an effect of the persistently and substantially lower cost environment than earlier expected. Longterm government securities yields fell after the announcement of Phase of the SelfFinancing Programme and are likely to continue declining as the announced measures are implemented. However persistently low costside inflationary pressure the slowdown in global growth and the historically low level of inflation expectations have heightened the risk of secondround effects which result in belowtarget inflation over a sustained period. In view of the March Inflation Report projection the Council assesses that the sustainable achievement of the inflation target has made it necessary to implement a comprehensive easing of monetary conditions. This consists of the reduction in the policy rate and the asymmetric narrowing of the central bank interest rate corridor. As a result the central bank base rate has been reduced by basis points to. per cent the overnight deposit rate to. per cent i.e. into negative territory and the overnight lending rate to. per cent. The Monetary Council remains ready to use every instrument at its disposal to contain secondround inflationary effects. Interest rate cuts will continue as long as monetary conditions become consistent with the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. In addition to the central bank base rate the Monetary Council will henceforth also decide on the current levels of the overnight deposit and lending rates that is the width of the interest rate corridor at its interest ratesetting meetings. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April .,135,2016
2016-04-26,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from April In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. The annual inflation rate and core inflation both decreased in March relative to the previous month. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation contains the increase in domestic consumer price inflation. Core inflation rises gradually as a result of the recovery in household consumption and the pickup in wages. Inflation expectations remain at historically low levels. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only approaches it in the first half of. The Hungarian economy grew dynamically again in the fourth quarter of. Over the last year as a whole the economy grew at a rate close to per cent. Based on monthly indicators economic activity slowed in the first quarter of. Annual growth in industrial output in February was lower than the high levels recorded at the end of and the volume of construction output also fell relative to the same period of the previous year. However according to February data retail sales grew at a faster pace than in previous months. The employment rate rose and the unemployment rate fell further. The deceleration in funding inflows from the EU leads to a slowdown in growth but the Banks and with a growing significance the Governments policy measures are making an increasing contribution to the economic recovery. In the Councils assessment economic growth accelerates again from the middle of the year and a growth rate of around per cent can be maintained through the Banks Growth Supporting Programme as well as the steps taken by the Government to encourage home construction and to facilitate the faster drawdown of EU transfers. Rising incomes the pickup in lending and the gradual decline in households precautionary considerations contribute to the expansion in consumption which in turn provides a considerable support for economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest policy decision mainly driven by expectations related to the monetary policy stance of the worlds leading central banks and news coming from oil markets. Shortterm interbank yields and government bond yields have declined since the previous policy decision. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. The unconventional targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank facilitate a decline in longterm yields and consequently an easing in monetary conditions. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures remain moderate for an extended period. The real economy has a disinflationary impact over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the March Inflation Report projection hold inflation will approach the per cent target only in the first half of. Phase of the SelfFinancing Programme has contributed to a decline in longterm government securities yields. The risks of secondround effects resulting in belowtarget inflation over a sustained period remain due to persistently low costside inflationary pressure the slowdown in global growth and the historically low level of inflation expectations. The Monetary Council has continued its interest rate cutting cycle in order to mitigate these risks and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by basis points. The Council has left the overnight deposit rate unchanged at. per cent and lowered the overnight lending rate by basis points to. per cent. The Monetary Council remains ready to use every instrument at its disposal to contain secondround inflationary effects. In the Councils assessment the sustainable achievement of the inflation target points to a further slight reduction in the policy rate. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on May .,136,2016
2016-05-24,In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth will continue following a temporary pause. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. The annual inflation rate and core inflation both rose in April. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the increase in domestic consumer price inflation. Domestic inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth accelerated early this year which in turn is likely to gradually raise core inflation through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only approaches it in the first half of. The Hungarian economic output grew more moderately than expected in the first quarter of relative to a year earlier. GDP decreased compared with the end of the previous year reflecting strong oneoff effects. The slower drawdown of funding from the EU relative to recent years caused a sharp slowdown in construction output while temporary factory shutdowns led to a fall in industrial production. By contrast retail sales continued to expand further in March and have on balance grown at a stable rate in recent months. Parallel to the rise in the employment rate the unemployment rate continued to fall. Economic growth is likely to exhibit strongly contrasting developments during the year as a whole. The Council expects growth to pick up notably in the second half of the year following moderate dynamics in the first half. The unwinding of oneoff factors as well as steps taken by both the Bank and the Government to support growth result in the economy picking up again. On the whole the Growth Supporting Programme the expansion in home construction and the faster drawdown of EU transfers help maintain a growth rate of around per cent. Moderate growth early this year is expected to result in the output gap opening up temporarily however looking forward the expansionary impact on demand of next years draft budget is likely to speed up the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the pickup in lending will contribute to the expansion in consumption which in turn provides a considerable support to economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has deteriorated slightly since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision mainly driven by weakerthanexpected macroeconomic data from the US and the euro area and news coming from oil markets. In line with a reduction in global risk appetite domestic longterm government bond yields have risen since the previous policy decision. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. The international rating agency Fitch has upgraded Hungarys longterm government debt rating to investment grade. This step is expected to contribute to further improvement in the risk assessment of the economy. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Forwardlooking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures remain moderate for an extended period. The real economy has a disinflationary impact over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the March Inflation Report projection hold inflation is expected to approach the per cent target in the first half of. Recent wage data suggest that the risk of secondround effects resulting from an excessively low level of inflation expectations has diminished. In addition next years draft budget also leads to the closing of the output gap. In the Councils assessment with the current basis point reduction the policy rate has reached the level of. per cent which ensures the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Council has left the overnight deposit rate unchanged at. per cent and lowered the overnight lending rate by basis points to. per cent. Based on available information the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the real economy point to maintaining the. per cent base rate for an extended period.,137,2016
2016-06-21,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from June In the Councils assessment the Hungarian economy is picking up again following the temporary deceleration at the beginning of the year. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. Looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. In May the annual inflation rate and core inflation both decreased relative to the previous month. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the increase in domestic consumer price inflation. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth accelerated further which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only approaches it in the first half of. Hungarian economic output grew moderately in the first quarter of relative to a year earlier. GDP decreased compared with the previous quarter reflecting strong temporary oneoff effects. The slower drawdown of funding from the EU relative to recent years caused a sharp slowdown in construction output while temporary factory shutdowns led to a fall in industrial production. However the volume of industrial output recovered already in April and production rose again. Retail sales continued to expand further in April. Household consumption is expected to rise further in the coming quarters. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the unemployment rate continued to be low in April. The time profile of this years economic growth is characterised by duality. The economy is expected to pick up markedly following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year. The unwinding of oneoff factors as well as the steps taken by both the Bank and the Government to support growth result in the economy picking up again. In June the Monetary Council decided to increase the total amount available under the Funding for Growth Scheme by HUF billion in order to provide further support to economic growth. On the whole the Growth Supporting Programme the expansion in home construction and the faster drawdown of EU transfers help maintain a growth rate of around per cent. Moderate growth early this year results in a more negative output gap temporarily however the acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next years budget is likely to speed up the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the expected pickup in lending will contribute to the expansion in consumption which in turn provides a considerable support to economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision mainly influenced by expectations related to an interest rate increase by the Fed the release of mixed macroeconomic data in developed countries uncertainty around the United Kingdoms EU membership and news from the oil market. Yields on domestic longterm government securities have not changed notably since the previous policy decision. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures remain moderate for an extended period. The real economys disinflationary impact is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. If the Monetary Council assesses it necessary in the future it may also decide to use unconventional tools. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on July .,138,2016
2016-07-26,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from July In the Councils assessment the Hungarian economy is picking up again following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of the year. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. Looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. In June the annual inflation rate remained unchanged and core inflation fell relative to the previous month. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the increase in domestic consumer price inflation. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth remains strong which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only approaches it in the first half of. In the Councils assessment domestic economic growth is picking up again as temporary effects wear off. Retail sales continued to expand further at a dynamic rate during the spring months. In May industrial production rose substantially relative to the same period of the previous year. Household consumption is expected to continue growing in the coming quarters. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the unemployment rate fell further in May accompanied by an increase in the number of employees. The time profile of this years economic growth is characterised by divergent trends. The economy is expected to pick up following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year mainly supported by domestic demand. The unwinding of adverse oneoff factors affecting growth early in the year as well as the steps taken by both the Bank and the Government to support growth will result in the economy picking up again. Economic growth of around per cent can be maintained by the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme the Growth Supporting Programme as well as the Governments measures to promote housing construction and the faster drawdown of EU funding. Moderate growth early this year is expected to result in a more negative output gap temporarily however the acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next years budget contribute to the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the expected pickup in lending will contribute to the expansion in consumption which in turn provides considerable support to economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision mainly influenced by the outcome of the referendum on EU membership in the United Kingdom and uncertainty around the countrys exit from the EU. Domestic financial markets proved stable in the turbulent atmosphere characterising global financial markets. A decline was observed along the yield curve since the previous policy decision. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Following the previous signal by the Council the change to monetary policy instruments announced in July supports further reduction in vulnerability and encourages lending using targeted unconventional tools. In view of the assessment of the effects related to the announced measures as well as the volatile global financial environment the Magyar Nemzeti Bank continues to monitor movements in interbank rates and developments in the money and government securities markets. The Monetary Council will make a decision on the yearend required level of the threemonth deposit and the operational details of the use of the facility in September. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy.

2016-08-23,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from August In the second quarter of the growth of the Hungarian economy picked up again following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of the year. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. Looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. In July consumer prices were slightly lower than a year earlier and core inflation rose somewhat relative to the previous month. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth remains strong which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only approaches it in the first half of. Hungarian economic growth picked up again in the second quarter of in line with the Banks expectations. Retail sales continued to expand at a dynamic rate in June. Household consumption is expected to continue growing in the coming quarters. Industrial production fell in June relative to the same period a year earlier. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the unemployment rate fell further in the second quarter accompanied by an increase in the number of employees. The time profile of this years economic growth is characterised by duality. The economy picks up following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year mainly supported by domestic demand. The unwinding of adverse oneoff factors affecting growth early in the year as well as the steps taken by both the Bank and the Government to support growth will result in the economy picking up further. Economic growth of around per cent can be maintained by the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme the Growth Supporting Programme and the Governments measures to promote housing construction as well as by the faster drawdown and efficient use of EU funding. Moderate growth early this year has resulted in a more negative output gap temporarily however the acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next years budget contribute to the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the pickup in lending will contribute to the expansion in consumption which in turn provides considerable support to economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been positive since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision. Domestic asset prices have changed little over recent weeks. The forint exchange rate remains stable and yields fell slightly at the entire length of the curve. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Following the previous signal by the Council the change to monetary policy instruments announced in July supports a further reduction in vulnerability and encourages lending using targeted unconventional tools. In view of the assessment of the effects related to the announced measures as well as the volatile global financial environment the Magyar Nemzeti Bank continues to closely monitor movements in interbank rates and developments in the money market and government securities market. The Monetary Council will make a decision on the required yearend level of the threemonth deposit stock and the operational details of the use of the facility in September.

2016-09-20,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from September In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth will continue to pick up in the remaining part of the year following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of the year. There continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. Looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. In August consumer prices were slightly lower than a year earlier. Core inflation decreased somewhat relative to the previous month. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Inflation is expected to rise gradually into positive range in the coming months. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth remains strong which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only gets close to it by the middle of. Hungarian economic growth picked up again in the second quarter of in line with the Banks expectations. Growth has been supported primarily by final consumption and net exports and on the output side by growing services driven by the pickup in domestic demand as well as by the correction in industrial and agricultural performance. Wholeeconomy investment continued to decrease relative to the same period a year earlier mainly as a consequence of the decline in government investments financed by EU funds. Retail sales expanded in July also. Household consumption is expected to grow further in the coming quarters. Industrial production fell in July relative to the same period a year earlier caused by the longer factory shutdowns in the summer in various manufacturing subsectors. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the number of employees increased again while the unemployment rate remained at a low level. The time profile of this years economic growth is characterised by duality. The economy picks up following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year mainly supported by domestic demand. Economic growth of around per cent can be achieved overall by the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme the Growth Supporting Programme the easing steps of monetary policy as well as the Governments measures. Moderate growth early this year has resulted in a more negative output gap temporarily however the acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next years fiscal budget contribute to the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the pickup in lending are contributing to the expansion in household consumption which in turn strongly promotes economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision mainly driven by the release of macroeconomic data in the US and the euro area as well as by expectations about further actions by the worlds leading central banks. Short and mediumterm domestic government securities yields and interbank rates fell sharply since July in response to the Councils earlier announcement about the change to monetary policy instruments. But they have remained broadly unchanged in the weeks since the previous policy decision while the forint exchange rate remained stable. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. These factors have also contributed significantly to the fact that the SP as the second of the large credit rating agencies has upgraded Hungarys debt rating back to investment grade. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative range and are declining even further as inflation rises. However in the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At todays meeting the Monetary Council set a HUF billion upper limit on yearend stock of threemonth central bank deposits. Following the decision according to the expectations of the Monetary Council at least HUF billion liquidity will be crowded out from the facility. The Council considers the limit on the threemonth deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. The limit will be set quarterly. On the next occasion a decision on its level as at end of the first quarter of will be made in December. With this limitation the central bank achieves the loosening of monetary conditions and also the corresponding support to economic growth through a decline in the money market rates. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank closely monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period and the loosening of monetary conditions by the limitation of the deposit facility are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. If subsequently it is warranted to loosen the monetary conditions further to meet the inflation target the Monetary Council will stand ready to apply a stronger limitation to threemonth deposits.

2016-10-25,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from October In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up from the middle of the year following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of. There continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. Looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. As the Monetary Council expected inflation rose again into positive territory in September. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth remains strong which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only gets close to it by the middle of. Hungarian economic growth accelerated in the second quarter of and based on monthly indicators it picked up further in the third quarter in line with the Banks expectations. The robust expansion in retail sales continued in August. Further growth is expected in household consumption in the coming quarters. Industrial production increased strongly in August. This growth following the decline in previous months is primarily due to the rise in vehicle industry output. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the number of employees increased again while the unemployment rate fell further. Both corporate and household lending increased in August. New household loans exceeded repayments for the first time since the crisis. The time profile of this years economic growth is characterised by duality. Following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year the pickup in domestic demand the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme the Growth Supporting Programme the easing measures of monetary policy as well as the Governments measures will help achieve economic growth of around per cent. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision mainly driven by news related to the oil market and the stability of some European banks as well as by expectations about monetary policy actions by the worlds leading central banks. The forint appreciated against the euro and shortterm money market rates and government securities yields fell overall. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. However in the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in September the Monetary Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the yearend stock of threemonth central bank deposits which according to the Councils expectation means the crowding out of at least HUF billion liquidity from the deposit facility. The Council considers the limit on the threemonth deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. At its meeting today the Monetary Council decided to lower the required reserve ratio for banks from per cent to per cent effective from December. As a result freely available liquidity of the banking system will expand further by HUF billion. The Bank aims to ease monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through a decline in money market rates. The Monetary Council is making every effort to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of threemonth deposits exerts its expected easing effect efficiently. The Monetary Council decided to leave the base rate unchanged. In order to increase the banking systems liquidity and ease monetary conditions further the Council reduced the overnight lending rate by basis points to. per cent while leaving the overnight deposit rate unchanged at. per cent. As a result the interest rate corridor narrowed further. In accordance with this the interest rate on the oneweek central bank loan fell by basis points to. per cent. In the Councils assessment there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period and the loosening of monetary conditions by the change in the monetary policy instruments are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank closely monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. If subsequently warranted by the achievement of the inflation target the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further.

2016-11-22,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from November In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up from the end of the year following the temporary slowdown. There continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Banks target. Looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. Inflation rose further in October in line with the Banks expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Wholeeconomy wage growth remains strong which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the per cent target over the forecast period and only gets close to it by the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew by per cent in the third quarter of relative to the same period a year earlier. The robust expansion in retail sales continued in September. In the coming quarters household consumption is expected to grow further thus consumption expenditures remain determining factors of economic growth. Industrial production fell in September compared to a year earlier. The growth rate of the sectors output moderated significantly in the third quarter reflecting among other things the temporary fall in vehicle industry output. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the number of employees increased again while the unemployment rate fell further. Both corporate and household lending rose in September. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision mainly driven by expectations about the US presidential elections and about an interest rate increase by the Fed as well as by news related to the European banking sector. Developed market equity indices had a mixed performance while bond prices fell. The forint remained broadly unchanged against the euro. Due to international developments the yield curve of government securities shifted upwards at both the middle and the long end thus the curve steepened. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. All of these developments contributed significantly to the upgrade of the countrys sovereign rating by Moodys. This meant that Hungarys sovereign rating was raised to investment grade by all three leading international rating agencies. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in September the Monetary Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the yearend stock of threemonth central bank deposits which according to the Councils expectation means crowding out of at least HUF billion liquidity from the deposit facility.

2016-12-20,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from December In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up from the end of this year. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually dissipating. Inflation rises over the forecast period and reaches the inflation target in the first half of. Inflation rose in November in line with the Banks expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation remained broadly unchanged. Looking ahead wholeeconomy wage growth is likely to rise further as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the latest wage agreement. This in turn is likely to raise core inflation through an increase in household consumption. However with persistently low global inflation and historically low inflation expectations the consumer price index is expected to rise only gradually. In the current projection inflation reaches the per cent level consistent with price stability in the first half of. The Hungarian economy grew by. per cent in the third quarter of relative to the same period a year earlier. The strong expansion in household consumption was the main driving force behind growth. Retail sales rose further while industrial production fell in October relative to the same period of the previous year. Outstanding lending to small and mediumsized companies increased by around per cent in the third quarter and the stock of corporate loans has also started to show signs of a turnaround. Outstanding loans in the household sector grew further. Private sector investment picked up and government investment strongly linked to the use of EU funding fell sharply. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the number of employees increased and the unemployment rate fell further. Private sector wage growth accelerated. Household consumption is expected to grow further as wage growth strengthens which will be supported by the realisation of consumption deferred from previous years. Looking ahead Hungarys current account surplus is likely to decrease driven by rising domestic demand. The Council expects economic growth of over per cent in the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. Sentiment in global financial markets has been mostly favourable since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision. News from the oil market and expectations about the stability of the euroarea banking sector were the focus of attention. In December the US Fed and the ECB made decisions in diverging policy directions. As expected the Fed decided to raise interest rates and looking ahead moved towards a tighter policy path. By contrast the ECB decided to extend its quantitative easing programme. As a result euroarea monetary conditions most relevant for Hungarian monetary policy are expected to remain accommodative for a longer period. The majority of developed market equity indices rose while bond prices declined. The forint weakened against the euro. Yields on government securities fell along the entire yield curve. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils assessment the operation of the monetary policy toolkit extended in the last half year has been successful. The Council considers the limit on the threemonth deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of the instruments. The Bank aims to ease monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through a decline in money market rates. At its meeting in December the Monetary Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits as at the end of the first quarter of. The Council expects that this decision consistent with the gradual steps taken so far will mean the crowding out of at least HUF billion additional liquidity from the deposit facility. The Monetary Council aims to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of threemonth deposits exerts its expected easing effect efficiently. The limit is set quarterly. On the next occasion a decision on its level as at end of the second quarter of will be made in March. In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy while inflation is rising gradually to the target. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually dissipating over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period and the loosening of monetary conditions by the change in the monetary policy instruments are consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. If subsequently warranted by the achievement of the inflation target the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional targeted instruments.

2017-01-24,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from January In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually dissipating. Inflation rises over the forecast period and reaches the inflation target in the first half of. Due in part to base effects inflation rose further in December and was in line with the Banks expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation remained broadly unchanged. Wholeeconomy wage growth is likely to remain strong as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the wage agreement at the end of last year. According to our expectations to a smaller extent this leads to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus through an expansion in household consumption. With historically low inflation expectations the consumer price index approaches the inflation target only slowly and is projected to reach the per cent level consistent with price stability in the first half of. According to monthly indicators Hungarian economic growth continued in the fourth quarter of. In November the volume of retail sales increased further and industrial production rose slightly relative to the same period a year earlier. Outstanding lending to small and mediumsized companies increased by around per cent in the third quarter and the stock of corporate loans has already started to rise on the yearonyear comparison. The turnaround in household lending experienced last year has proved lasting. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the number of employees increased and the unemployment rate fell further. In parallel with continued strong wage growth at the end of last year household consumption is expected to grow further which will be supported by the realisation of consumption deferred from previous years as well. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall to nearly a half of its level over the forecast horizon driven by rising domestic demand. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of over per cent both this year and the next to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. Global financial markets have been calm overall since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision and risk indicators have fallen slightly although there have been significant tensions in some emerging economies. The US Fed and the ECB made decisions in diverging policy directions in December. As expected the Fed decided to raise interest rates and looking ahead moved towards a tighter policy path. By contrast the ECB decided to extend its quantitative easing programme. According to data published since then inflation rose in developed regions over the past month. This trend if it persists may pose a new challenge to the central banks of those economies. The majority of developed market equity indices rose slightly and movements in yields on longterm government securities were mixed. The forint appreciated against the euro. In the domestic government securities market yields at maturities of up to one year fell and those at longer maturities rose. The amount of liquidity crowded out following the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits has had a marked influence on money market rates. As a consequence the threemonth BUBOR has dropped to a historical low level of basis points and forint yields in the FX swap market have also fallen sharply. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates have fallen substantially over recent years and are expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in December the Monetary Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits as at the end of the first quarter of.

If subsequently warranted by the achievement of the inflation target the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional targeted instruments.

2017-02-28,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from March In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but looking ahead the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually dissipating. Inflation rises over the forecast period and reaches the inflation target in the first half of. Due primarily to base effects inflation rose further in January while the Banks measures of underlying inflation remained broadly unchanged. In the coming months the price index is likely to rise further temporarily due to the base effects. Thereafter inflation is likely to decrease again in the spring months as these effects gradually fade. Wholeeconomy wage growth is likely to remain strong as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the wage agreement at the end of last year. The upward effect of this on costs is likely to be offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and corporate taxes. According to our expectations to a smaller extent this leads to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus through an expansion in household consumption. With historically low inflation expectations the consumer price index approaches the inflation target gradually and is projected to reach the per cent level consistent with price stability in the first half of. Hungarian economic growth continued in the fourth quarter of. In December the volume of retail sales increased further and industrial production fell slightly relative to the same period a year earlier. Including selfemployed persons outstanding lending to small and mediumsized companies increased by nearly per cent in. Furthermore the total stock of corporate loans also increased markedly by more than per cent. The MNBs Marketbased Lending Scheme has supported significantly this dynamic growth the banks participating in the Scheme overperformed their net lending commitment of HUF billion for SMEs by more than per cent in on the whole. The turnaround in household lending experienced last year has proved lasting. Labour demand remained strong and therefore the number of employees increased and the unemployment rate fell further. In parallel with strong wage growth expected to continue this year household consumption is likely to grow dynamically which will be supported by the realisation of consumption deferred from previous years as well. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall to nearly a half of its amount over the forecast horizon driven by rising domestic demand. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of over per cent both this year and the next to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. Global financial markets have been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting decision and risk indicators have fallen slightly overall. Developed market equity indices rose and the majority of yields on longterm government securities declined. The forint appreciated against the euro. In the domestic government securities market yields at maturities of up to one year were broadly unchanged and those at longer maturities rose. The amount of liquidity crowded out following the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits has had a marked influence on money market rates. As a consequence the threemonth BUBOR has dropped to a historical low level of basis points and forint yields in the FX swap market have also fallen further. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates have fallen substantially over recent years and are expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in December the Monetary Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits as at the end of the first quarter of. The Monetary Council expects that this decision will mean the crowding out of at least HUF billion additional liquidity from the deposit facility.

2017-03-28,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from March In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy following the temporary slowdown last year but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as the economy grows. Inflation reaches the target sustainably from the first half of. The increase in inflation mainly driven by base effects continued in February. However the Banks measures of underlying inflation remained stable in line with expectations. The price index is likely to rise temporarily further slightly over the next month and then to fall below the target from the spring months as the base effects at the beginning of the year fade. Wholeeconomy wage growth is likely to pick up further reflecting the dynamic expansion in employment the tight labour market and the wage agreement at the end of last year. The upward effect of this on costs is likely to be offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate. To a smaller extent this is expected to lead to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus through an expansion in household consumption. In the baseline projection inflation reaches the per cent level consistent with price stability in a sustainable manner from the first half of. Hungarian economic growth continued in the fourth quarter of. In January the volume of retail sales picked up and industrial production rose relative to the same period a year earlier. Construction output grew strongly in January following the sharp decline in the previous year and output growth is expected to continue in the coming months. Labour demand remained strong. Employment continued to increase and the unemployment rate fell to a historic low. In parallel with strong wage growth household consumption is likely to grow dynamically which will be supported by the compensation of consumption deferred from previous years as well. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall significantly over the forecast horizon driven by rising domestic demand. The Funding for Growth Scheme which was launched in June will close at the end of March. The programme achieved its goal by facilitating financing for nearly companies it contributed greatly to the dynamic growth in SME borrowing which amounted to per cent last year. The transition to lending under market conditions is assisted by the Banks MarketBased Lending Scheme. Under this programme credit institutions have committed to expanding their lending by HUF billion this year. As a result growth of between per cent in lending to SMEs is expected to be maintained. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects stable annual economic growth of between per cent over the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. The divergence of monetary policies across the worlds major central banks has continued since the Councils latest interest ratesetting meeting. The US Fed continued its tightening cycle in line with expectations while the ECB being the most relevant for Hungarian monetary policy continues to maintain its loose monetary policy conditions. The majority of developed market equity indices and yields on longterm government securities rose. The amount of liquidity crowded out following the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a consequence the threemonth BUBOR remained at a historically low level and shortterm yields in the government securities market fell slightly. Domestic longterm yields rose somewhat in line with global trends. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates have fallen substantially over recent years and are expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Councils assessment the operation of the monetary policy toolkit extended in July has been successful the limit set on the threemonth deposit stock and its potential future change are considered to be integral parts of instruments. The Bank continues to aim to maintain loose monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through money market rates. In the second quarter banking sector liquidity is likely to decline more strongly than previously due mainly to the maturity of swap contracts related to the conversion of household foreign currency loans into forints and the rollover of maturing foreign currencydenominated government bonds in forints. For this reason at its meeting in March the Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits as at the end of the second quarter of in order to preserve the amount of liquidity crowded out over the past two quarters and thereby maintain the loose monetary conditions achieved. In addition the Council extended the existing range of swap instruments providing forint liquidity with and month facilities. The Monetary Council intends to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of threemonth deposits exerts its expected effect efficiently. The limit is set quarterly. On the next occasion a decision on its level as at end of the third quarter of will be made in June. In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy following the temporary slowdown last year but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as the economy grows. Over the forecast period inflation reaches the target sustainably from the first half of. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold maintaining the current level of the base rate and loose monetary conditions achieved through the change in monetary policy instruments for an extended period is consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Monetary Council monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. If inflation remains persistently below the target the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional targeted instruments. The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on April .,147,2017
2017-04-25,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from April In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows. Inflation reaches the target sustainably from the first half of. In March inflation eased to. per cent. That was below the March Inflation Report projection. The difference mainly reflected the volatile price dynamics of seasonal foods and the decline in tobacco prices despite the increase in excise taxes. Developments in the Banks measures of underlying inflation remained stable in line with expectations. Inflation is likely to continue to decrease over the coming months as the base effects at the beginning of the year fade. Wholeeconomy wage growth is likely to pick up further reflecting the dynamic expansion in employment the tight labour market and the wage agreement at the end of last year. The upward effect of this on costs is likely to be offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate. To a smaller extent this is expected to lead to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus through an expansion in household consumption. In the baseline projection inflation reaches the per cent level consistent with price stability in a sustainable manner from the first half of. The Hungarian economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter of and monthly indicators signal remarkable expansion in the first quarter of. In February industrial production rose significantly due in part to calendar effects. Construction output continued to grow strongly in February following the sharp decline in the previous year and is expected to pick up further in the coming months. The volume of retail sales grew slightly in February. Growth in the value of imports outpaced that in the value of exports. As a result the trade surplus decreased in February. Labour demand remained strong. Although employment moderated slightly the unemployment rate remained at historically low levels. In parallel with strong wage growth household consumption is likely to grow dynamically which will be supported by the compensation of consumption deferred from previous years as well. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall significantly over the forecast horizon driven by rising domestic demand. The Funding for Growth Scheme which was launched in June ended at the end of March. After the Scheme is phased out the transition to lending under market conditions will be assisted by the Banks MarketBased Lending Scheme. The Monetary Council expects that as a result growth of between per cent in lending to SMEs will be maintained. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects stable annual economic growth of between per cent over the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile since the Councils latest interest ratesetting meeting. Risk aversion increased after the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in March. The Czech National Bank abandoned the exchange rate floor against the euro in early April. This decision was followed by moderate reactions from foreign exchange markets. Developed market equity indices and yields on longterm government securities fell. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a consequence the threemonth BUBOR fell to a historically low level of basis points. The curve of interbank rates shifted downwards. Domestic short and longterm government security yields both fell. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates have fallen significantly over recent years and are expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in March the Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits as at the end of the second quarter of in order to preserve the amount of liquidity crowded out of the deposit facility and thereby to maintain the loose monetary conditions achieved. In addition the Council decided to introduce swap instruments with longer maturities of and months which it intends to use to support the maintenance of the current conditions over a prolonged period. The Council considers the limit on the threemonth deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. The Bank continues to aim to maintain loose monetary conditions and provide support to the economy through money market rates. The Monetary Council intends to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of threemonth deposits exerts its expected effect efficiently. The limit is set quarterly. On the next occasion a decision on its level as at end of the third quarter of will be made in June.

2017-05-23,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from May In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows. Inflation reaches the central bank target sustainably from the first half of. In April inflation eased to. per cent. The moderation in inflation mainly reflected the decline in the price index for fuel due primarily to base effects. Developments in the Banks measures of underlying inflation remained stable in line with expectations. Inflation is likely to remain close to the current level over the coming period. Wholeeconomy wage growth is likely to pick up further reflecting the dynamic expansion in employment the tight labour market and the wage agreement at the end of. The upward effect of this on costs is likely to be offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate. To a smaller extent this is expected to lead to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus through an expansion in household consumption. In the baseline projection inflation reaches the per cent level consistent with price stability in a sustainable manner from the first half of. The Hungarian economy expanded dynamically in the first quarter of. Gross domestic product grew by. per cent relative to the same period a year earlier according to preliminary data. In March industrial production rose significantly. In addition construction output also grew strongly and growth is expected to continue over the coming months. The expansion in the volume of retail sales continued in March. Growth in the value of imports outpaced that in the value of exports. As a result the trade surplus decreased in March. Labour demand remained strong. Employment rose slightly in the first quarter of and the unemployment rate remained at historically low levels. In parallel with strong wage growth household consumption is likely to grow dynamically which will be supported by the compensation of consumption deferred from previous years as well. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall significantly over the forecast horizon driven by rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects stable annual economic growth of between per cent over the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. The Funding for Growth Scheme which was launched in June ended at the end of March. After the Scheme is phased out the transition to lending under market conditions is ensured by the Banks MarketBased Lending Scheme. In consequence growth in lending to micro small and mediumsized enterprises may be maintained in the upper half of the per cent range deemed necessary for sustainable growth over the medium term. Sentiment in international financial markets was mostly favourable since the Councils latest interest ratesetting meeting but deteriorated at the end of the period. Risk appetite was mainly influenced by developments in geopolitical tensions the Feds and ECBs monetary policy the US governments actions the election outcomes in Europe and the aftereffects of the abandonment of the exchange rate floor in the Czech Republic. Risk indicators did not change significantly overall while developed market equity indices typically rose over the period. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a consequence the threemonth BUBOR remained at a historically low level. The interbank yield curve became flatter and yields fell markedly. Domestic shortterm government security yields were little changed while there was a significant decline at the middle and the long end of the yield curve of Hungarian government securities. As a result three and fiveyear yields reached near record low levels. Hungarys strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forwardlooking domestic money market real interest rates have fallen significantly over recent years and are expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period. In the Councils assessment a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in March the Council set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits as at the end of the second quarter of in order to preserve the amount of liquidity crowded out of the deposit facility and thereby to maintain the loose monetary conditions achieved. The swap instruments with maturities of and months introduced in March were used with success with strong demand by banks at the FX swap tenders. The Council considers the limit on the threemonth deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. The Bank continues to aim to maintain loose monetary conditions and provide support to the economy through money market rates.

2017-06-20,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from June In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner half a year later from early. In May inflation eased to. per cent. The moderation in inflation mainly reflected the decline in the price index for fuel due in part to base effects. Developments in the Banks measures of underlying inflation remained stable in line with expectations. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage at the start of the year led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the central banks expectations there has not yet been any upward pressure on inflation from wages. The rise in global inflation which started towards the end of came to a halt in recent months. In relation to the euro area the European Central Bank has revised its inflation forecast down for the next years. Consistent with this external inflation is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. The consumer price index is likely to remain around its current level in the summer months and then to rise slowly as the end of the year approaches. To a smaller extent the expansion in household consumption is expected to lead to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT reductions announced recently have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the baseline projection the percent inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner half a year later from early. The Hungarian economy expanded dynamically by. per cent in the first quarter of relative to the same period a year earlier. The main contributors to growth were investment industry and services in addition to consumption. Based on available monthly data Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue in the second quarter of. Industrial production may weaken from its strong performance in the second quarter of however the sectors performance is expected to improve in as a whole. Robust growth in construction is likely to continue in the coming months. In April the volume of retail sales continued to expand at a similar rate as at the beginning of the year. Labour demand remained strong. Employment rose slightly in the first quarter of and the unemployment rate remained at historically low levels. Driven by the continued expansion in household consumption and the pickup in investment activity domestic demand will play an increasing role in economic growth. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon driven by rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects stable annual economic growth of between per cent over the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. The Funding for Growth Scheme ended at the end of March.

In consequence growth in lending to micro small and mediumsized enterprises may be maintained in the upper half of the per cent range deemed necessary for sustainable growth over the medium term. Sentiment in international financial markets was mostly favourable since the Councils latest interest ratesetting meeting. Risk appetite was mainly influenced by the French elections the oil price agreement between OPEC members in line with expectations and by expectations related to the Feds and ECBs monetary policy. In the euro area market expectations on the interest rate path shifted down while the Feds expected interest rate path did not change markedly. Risk indicators and developed market equity indices did not change significantly overall. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a result the threemonth BUBOR remained at a historically low level. The interbank yield curve shifted down slightly.

The Monetary Council intends to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of threemonth deposits exerts its expected effect on monetary conditions efficiently. The Bank has managed uncertainties related to liquidity developments in the banking sector using finetuning operations introduced in October and extended with longer maturities in March. The limit is set quarterly. On the next occasion a decision on its level as at end of the fourth quarter of will be made in September. In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. Over the forecast period the inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner half a year later from early. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold maintaining the current level of the base rate and loose monetary conditions achieved through the change in monetary policy instruments for an extended period is consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. In the Councils assessment downside risks to inflation have increased with the change in the external environment. If inflation remains persistently below the target the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional targeted instruments.,150,2017
2017-07-28,At its meeting on July the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from July In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon.

In line with the Banks expectations there has not yet been any upward pressure on inflation from wages. Global inflation started to rise at the end of but has moderated in recent months. Price indices of the external environment and particularly that of the euro area are likely to remain low for a prolonged period. The consumer price index is likely to remain near its current level over the remainder of this year. To a smaller extent the expansion in household consumption is expected to lead to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts announced for next year have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the baseline projection the percent inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early.

Industrial production rose significantly in May and the sectors performance is expected to pick up in as a whole. Robust growth in construction is likely to continue in the coming months. In May the volume of retail sales picked up. Labour demand remained strong. Employment was broadly unchanged during the spring of and the unemployment rate remained at historically low levels. Driven by the continued expansion in household consumption and the strong growth in investment activity the increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of between percent over the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. The Funding for Growth Scheme ended at the end of March. After it was phased out the transition to lending under market conditions is ensured by the Banks MarketBased Lending Scheme introduced in early and extended in. At the tender held in the second phase of the Scheme in July commercial banks raised their lending commitment by onethird. This will ensure that growth in lending to SMEs is maintained in the upper half of the percent range deemed necessary by the MNB for sustainable economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has been calm for most of the period since the Councils latest interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced mainly by expectations related to the Feds and the ECBs monetary policy. Market expectations on both the ECBs and the Feds interest rate path shifted up. Overall risk indicators were unchanged and developed market equity indices fell. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a result the threemonth BUBOR remained at a historically low level. The interbank yield curve steepened. Yields on shortterm government securities up to oneyear maturity were little changed while there was an increase at the long end of the yield curve of Hungarian government securities. Three and fiveyear yields are near record low levels.

2017-08-22,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from August In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early. In July inflation rose to. percent and core inflation to. percent. The increase in core inflation adjusted for the effects of indirect taxes primarily reflected the change in processed food prices. Developments in the Banks measures of underlying inflation remained stable in line with expectations. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Banks expectations there has not yet been any upward pressure on inflation from wages. Global inflation started to rise at the end of but has moderated in recent months. The external inflation environment particularly in the euro area is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. The consumer price index is likely to rise temporarily in the coming months before easing back to around current levels by the end of the year. To a smaller extent the expansion in household consumption is expected to lead to higher core inflation and to a greater extent to a reduction in the trade surplus. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts announced for next year have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the baseline projection the percent inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early. The GDP data for the second quarter of showed that Hungarian economic output growth continued. Industrial production rose again in June and the sectors performance is expected to be buoyant in as a whole. Robust growth in construction is likely to continue in the coming months. In June the volume of retail sales rose. Labour demand remained strong employment grew further in the second quarter of and the unemployment rate remained at historically low levels. Driven mainly by the strong growth in investment alongside continued expansion in household consumption the increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects stable annual economic growth of between percent over the coming years to which the Banks and the Governments measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. The Funding for Growth Scheme ended at the end of March. After it was phased out the transition to lending under market conditions is ensured by the Banks MarketBased Lending Scheme introduced in early and extended in. At the tender held in the second phase of the Scheme in July commercial banks raised their lending commitment by onethird. This will ensure that growth in lending to SMEs is maintained in the upper half of the percent range deemed necessary by the MNB for sustainable economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has been mixed in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced mainly by the release of macroeconomic data and expectations related to the monetary policy of the worlds leading central banks. Market expectations for the timing of policy tightening by the ECB have shifted out. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region improved which led to an appreciation of local currencies. Inflation has been rising in the countries of the region. However in light of the changed monetary conditions and the different inflation targets market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a result the threemonth BUBOR remained at a historically low level. The interbank yield curve flattened. Yields on shortterm government securities up to oneyear maturity were little changed while there was a slight increase at the long end of the yield curve of Hungarian government securities. Three and fiveyear yields are near record low levels.

In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. Over the forecast period the inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early. If the assumptions underlying the Banks projections hold it is the maintenance for an extended period of the current level of the base rate and the loose monetary conditions achieved through the change in monetary policy instruments earlier which is consistent with the mediumterm achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. In the Councils assessment the external environment continues to pose a downside risk to inflation. The Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional targeted instruments to ensure the monetary conditions necessary to meet the inflation target in a sustainable manner.,152,2017
2017-09-19,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from September In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. In the September projection the inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner one additional quarter later i.e. by the middle of following a delay of half a year indicated in the June projection. In August inflation rose to. percent and core inflation to. percent. The increase in core inflation mainly reflected base effects and temporary effects such as changes in the prices of tobacco and dairy products. In line with the Banks expectations measures of underlying inflation were around percent significantly below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Banks expectations there has not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. The rise in global inflation which started at the beginning of the year has stalled and consumer price indices in some economies have fallen. The European Central Bank revised down its projection for euroarea inflation again. External inflation particularly in the euro area is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. In the coming months the consumer price index is likely to decline again from its current level to the bottom of the tolerance band by the end of. Core inflation is expected to decrease in the second half of next year as the temporary effects wane. Looking ahead the Banks measures of underlying inflation are expected to be around percent. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts announced for next year have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. According to the projection of the September Inflation Report the price stability target can be achieved sustainably one quarter later i.e. by the middle of. Growth of the Hungarian economy continued in the second quarter of. Industrial production stagnated in July due to factory shutdowns in the summer. A reversal and gradual pickup in industrial production is expected towards the end of the year. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Retail sales growth slowed somewhat in July. Labour demand remained strong employment was at historically high levels in the second quarter of. The unemployment rate remained at a low level. The general increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of. percent in and stable growth of between percent over the coming years. The Banks and the Governments stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has on the whole improved in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Besides to an escalation in geopolitical risks favourable macroeconomic data and negotiations about Brexit also had an effect on risk appetite. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. The threemonth BUBOR fell to a new historic low. The yield curves for the interbank and government securities markets shifted downwards. Three and fiveyear yields on government securities are at their historical lows. Achieved through the change in monetary policy instruments the earlier loose monetary conditions necessary to meet the inflation target in a sustainable manner have on the whole become tighter in recent months. The repeated delay in the date of meeting the inflation target also warrants monetary easing. The Monetary Council decided on harmonised measures to ensure the adequate monetary conditions. In particular the Council reduced the interest rate on the overnight central bank deposit by basis points. In addition it set a HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth central bank deposits outstanding from the end of. The stock of swap instruments will be increased in the coming period. The objective of the latter is to provide the loosening effect up to the longest possible section of the yield curve as soon as possible. In the Councils assessment the limitation on the stock of threemonth deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF billion yearend upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. The importance of the stock and maturity structure of swap instruments providing forint liquidity increases in the future. In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner one additional quarter later i.e. by the middle of following a delay of half a year indicated in the June projection. The Council lowered the overnight deposit rate by basis points to. percent and left the base rate the overnight and oneweek lending rates unchanged. The Council considers that the external environment continues to pose a downside risk to inflation. In the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The Monetary Council will continue to monitor closely the risks to inflation and developments in monetary conditions and will stand ready to ease them further using additional unconventional targeted instruments.,153,2017
2017-10-24,At its meeting on October the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from October In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In September inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Headline inflation fell slightly short of our expectation with the decline in volatile unprocessed food prices accounting for the difference. Core inflation was in line with the September Inflation Report projection. The Banks measures of underlying inflation rose slightly compared with the previous month but continued to be significantly below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Banks expectations there has still not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. The rise in global inflation which started at the beginning of the year has stalled and consumer price indices in some economies have fallen. External inflation particularly in the euro area is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. In the coming months the consumer price index is likely to decline again from its current level to the bottom of the tolerance band by the end of. Core inflation is expected to decrease in the second half of next year as the temporary effects related to changes in tobacco and dairy product prices fade. Looking ahead the Banks measures of underlying inflation are expected to be around percent. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts announced for next year have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the September projection the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of. According to monthly data Hungarian economic growth continued in the third quarter of. Industrial production increased in August. Fluctuations in industrial output in the summer months has mainly reflected the different timing of factory shutdowns compared with last year. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Retail sales growth picked up in August. Labour demand is still strong employment was at historically high levels in the summer of. The unemployment rate remained at a low level. The general increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of. percent in and stable growth of between percent over the coming years. The Banks and the Governments stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has on the whole been positive in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Expectations about the monetary policy of the worlds leading central banks were the main factor influencing investors appetite for risk. The Feds interest rate path expected by the market did not change significantly. The European Central Bank is still likely to maintain loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Market participants expect the first interest rate rise to occur later than previously thought. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. In addition the stock of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity continued to increase and the average maturity of outstanding swap contracts lengthened in line with the Councils aim. The threemonth BUBOR fell to a new historic low. The yield curves for the interbank and government securities markets shifted downwards. Overall yields on longterm government securities have fallen since the previous interest rate decision. However the steepness of the yield curve continued to be high in international comparison which signs there is still room for reducing longterm yields further. In the Councils assessment the gradual limitation on the stock of threemonth deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF billion yearend upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. Therefore the importance of the stock and maturity structure of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity will increase the objective of which is to provide the loosening effect up to the longest possible section of the yield curve. In the future the Council decides on the amount of liquidity crowded out on a regular frequency and adjusts the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly. In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. However the September Inflation Report indicated downside risks to inflation. The Council judges that the likelihood of these materialising has increased recently. It is important for the Council to ensure that the low interest rate environment exerts its favourable effect as long as possible. To achieve this it is necessary to reduce longterm yields and as a result the steepness of the yield curve which will also promote the expansion of loans with long interest rate fixation. The Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further and is considering unconventional instruments to be used accordingly.,154,2017
2017-11-21,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from November In the Councils assessment Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In October inflation decreased to. percent and core inflation to. percent. Both headline and core inflation came in somewhat below the Banks and the markets expectations with the moderate dynamics of services and tradables prices accounting for most of the difference. The Banks measures of underlying inflation declined compared with the previous month and continued to be significantly below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Banks expectations there has still not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. Oil prices have risen in recent months. Global underlying inflation continues to be moderate. External inflation particularly in the euro area is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. Following a temporary rise the consumer price index is likely to decline again to the bottom of the tolerance band by the end of. Core inflation is expected to decrease in the second half of next year as the temporary effects related to changes in tobacco and dairy product prices fade.

Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts announced for next year have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the September projection the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the third quarter of. In September industrial production increased relative to a year earlier at a rate similar to those in previous months the volume of retail sales picked up. Labour demand remained strong employment was at historically high levels in the third quarter of. The unemployment rate continued to fall. The general increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth.

The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of. percent in and stable growth of between percent over the coming years. The Banks and the Governments stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has on the whole been positive in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Monetary policy decisions by the worlds leading central banks and the latest macroeconomic data were the main factors influencing investors appetite for risk. The balance sheet reduction programme of the Fed has started in October however market prices suggest no major change in interest rate expectations. In October the European Central Bank announced that it would slow the pace of its asset purchases from January. Nevertheless persistently loose monetary conditions are expected in the period ahead. Market participants anticipate the ECBs first interest rate hike to occur even later than previously thought in the middle of. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. In the Councils assessment the gradual limitation on the stock of threemonth deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF billion yearend upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. Therefore the importance of the stock and maturity structure of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity will increase. In the future the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity crowded out on a regular frequency and will adjust the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly. The reduction in the overnight deposit rate in September the amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits and central bank communication addressing longerterm yields had a marked influence on domestic money market rates. In addition the stock of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity continued to increase and the average maturity of outstanding swap contracts lengthened in line with the Councils aim. The threemonth BUBOR was at its historic low. Longterm yields have declined in the government securities and interbank markets since the previous interest rate decision and therefore the difference between short and longterm yields has narrowed. However the yield curve is still steep in international comparison. The Council considers it important that the loose monetary conditions have their effect not only at the short but also at the longer end of the yield curve. To ensure this the Council decided to introduce two unconventional instruments from January which will constitute an integral part of the Banks set of monetary policy instruments. Accordingly the Council will introduce unconditional interest rate swap IRS facilities with five and tenyear maturities the allocation amount of which has been set at HUF billion for the first quarter of. The IRS facilities will be available for counterparty banks at regular tenders from the beginning of January. In addition the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will launch a targeted programme aimed at purchasing mortgage bonds with maturities of three years or more. Both programmes will also contribute to an increase in the share of loans with long periods of interest rate fixation. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will make a decision on the operational details of the programmes in December. In the Councils assessment some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner.

2017-12-19,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from December In the Councils assessment in parallel with the pickup in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will continue to be dynamic in then it will slow down. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In November inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. In the autumn months inflation was basically in line with the September Inflation Report projection however core inflation fell short of the forecast. The difference was mainly attributable to the price dynamics of market services. The Banks measures of underlying inflation remained unchanged compared with the summer months and continued to be significantly below core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Banks expectations there has still not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. Oil prices have risen in recent months. In the euro area underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the coming years as well. According to our current projection following a temporary rise in November the consumer price index is likely to decline again to close to per cent at the end of then in the first months of it will level off at the bottom edge of the tolerance band. Over the medium term the secondround effects resulting from buoyant domestic demand increase in wage costs as well as higher commodity prices will point to the increase in domestic core inflation. However moderate external inflation and inflation expectations stabilising at historically low levels as well as subsequent reductions in employers social contributions the VAT rate cuts announced for next year are slowing the rise in prices. In our projection the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the third quarter of. Industrial production and the volume of retail sales picked up in October. Labour demand remained strong employment was close to historically high levels in AugustOctober. The unemployment rate continued to fall. Looking ahead the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall in driven by rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding. In the Councils assessment GDP growth will approach per cent in and then it will slow down from onwards according to the current projection. The Banks and the Governments stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has on the whole been positive in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. News of negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom favourable projections for global growth and the European political events were the main factors influencing investors appetite for risk. In December the Fed decided to further increase the base rate however market prices suggested no major change in interest rate expectations. Looking ahead the European Central Bank is likely to maintain loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continue to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market prices suggest that the timing of central bank actions will differ. Yields in the domestic money and capital markets declined to their historic low. Shortterm yields are at a level close to or below zero. The liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits the reduction in the overnight central bank deposit rate as well as the increase in the size and the average original maturity of the stock of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity have had a marked influence on shortterm yields. Longterm yields have decreased significantly in the last three months which is mostly the result of the MNBs forward guidance and the announcement of the central bank interest rate swap instruments and the mortgage bond purchase programme in November. The Hungarian yield curve shifted downwards markedly in a regional comparison as well however it is still steep in international comparison. In the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end the Monetary Council maintained the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. per cent and the overnight deposit rate at. per cent. In the Councils assessment the gradual limitation on the stock of threemonth deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF billion yearend upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. In line with maintaining monetary conditions the Council set a HUF billion band for the targeted average liquidity crowdedout for the first quarter of which is equal to that of the fourth quarter of. On the next occasion the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity crowded out in March and will adjust the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly. The Councils aim is that the loose monetary conditions have their effect not only at the short but also at the longer end of the yield curve. To ensure this in November the Council decided to introduce two unconventional instruments from January which will constitute an integral part of the Banks set of monetary policy instruments. In harmony with the Councils forward guidance the new instruments contribute efficiently to the maintenance of loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period. Accordingly the Council will introduce unconditional interest rate swap IRS facilities with five and tenyear maturities the maximum allotted amount of which has been set at HUF billion for the first quarter of. In addition the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will launch a targeted programme aimed at purchasing mortgage bonds with maturities of three years or more. The Council expects an increase in mortgage bond issuance and an improvement of market activity due to the measure. The maximum allotted amount for the security purchase programme amounts to per cent of the everprevailing mortgagebond stock on the market. Both programmes will contribute to an increase in the share of loans with long periods of interest rate fixation thereby improving financial stability. After several rounds of consultation with banks the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will make a decision on the operational details of the programmes until December and will inform market participants about this in a release. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions at both short and long ends for an extended period is necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The Council will closely monitor developments in monetary conditions and will ensure the persistence of loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period by using the extended set of monetary policy instruments.,156,2017

Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continue to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market prices suggest that the timing of central bank actions will differ. Yields in the domestic money and capital markets were around their historic low. Shortterm yields are at a level close to or below zero. Longterm yields with increased volatility at the end of the period have fallen significantly overall in the past months. The decline in yields has occurred in a way that the spreads relative to the Euro Area and regional yields have significantly narrowed. In the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end the Monetary Council maintained the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. per cent and the overnight deposit rate at. per cent.

To ensure this the central bank started targeted mortgage bond purchases in January and held the first tender of the unconditional monetary policy interest rate swap facility. In view of the experiences gained from the first tender the central bank finetuned the details of the programme to achieve more effective monetary transmission. The MNB will continue mortgage bond purchases and the monetary policy interest rate swap facility as programmes continuously and for a prolonged period thus they constitute an integral part of the set of monetary policy instruments. In harmony with the Councils forward guidance the new instruments contribute efficiently to the maintenance of loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period and contribute to an increase in the share of loans with long periods of interest rate fixation thereby improving financial stability. The Monetary Council focuses on the relative position of domestic longterm yields relative to international yields when evaluating the programme.

2018-02-27,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from February In the Councils assessment in parallel with the pickup in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level.

The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In January inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Inflation and core inflation were in line with the Banks expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation remained unchanged overall and continued to be significantly below core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions at the beginning of the year and in the corporate tax rate in. As last year there were moderate price movements in the service sector at the beginning of thus in line with the Banks expectations there has not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. Oil prices fell significantly following the rise in recent months. According to the European Central Banks projections underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well.

In our projection the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the fourth quarter of. Industrial production and the volume of retail sales continued to grow in December. Labour demand remained strong employment was at historically high levels in the final quarter of. The unemployment rate fell further. Strong credit growth continued. Outstanding lending to the corporate sector increased by some percent relative to a year earlier. Within this the stock of lending to SMEs grew even more strongly. In the household sector annual growth in lending was close to percent. A significant part of this was related to the expansion in housing loans. Looking ahead the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. From a historically high level of. percent observed earlier Hungarys current account surplus is expected to fall to around percent in driven by rising domestic demand and to remain in positive territory over the longer term. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding. In the Councils assessment GDP growth will be around percent in as in then it will slow down from if the assumptions underlying the current projection hold. The Banks and the Governments measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has on the whole deteriorated in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision accompanied by increased volatility. Macroeconomic data releases and expectations related to future monetary policy of the worlds leading central banks were the main factors influencing investors appetite for risk. The Fed decided to maintain interest rates at the end of January. Market participants continue to expect the next interest rate increase to take place in March. Looking ahead the European Central Bank is likely to maintain loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continue to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market prices suggest monetary policy stances by regional central banks will continue to differ. The short end of the market yield curve shifted upwards while the Banks guidance about the maintenance of loose monetary conditions over an extended period remained unchanged. Hungarian longterm yield spreads rose amid the increase in yields in international financial markets over the recent period. Over a longer horizon however spreads relative to the euro area and the region decreased significantly. In the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end the Monetary Council maintained the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. per cent and the overnight deposit rate at. per cent. In line with maintaining monetary conditions while keeping the HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits the Council set a HUF billion band for the targeted average liquidity crowdedout for the first quarter of which is equal to that of the fourth quarter of.

2018-03-27,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from March In the Councils assessment in parallel with the pickup in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in then according to the current projection it will slow down gradually from. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In February inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Inflation and core inflation were in line with the Banks expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation remained unchanged and continued to be significantly below core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage had led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages which continued into early. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions at the beginning of the year and in the corporate tax rate in. At the beginning of services prices rose somewhat faster than last year though still at a moderate pace. Consequently in line with the Banks expectations there has not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. Oil prices slightly increased over the past month. According to the ECBs projections underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. According to our current projection the consumer price index will remain in the lower half of the tolerance band in the coming months. Over the medium term buoyant domestic demand and the increase in wage costs will point to an increase in domestic core inflation. However moderate external inflation and inflation expectations stabilising at historically low levels as well as subsequent reductions in employers social contributions and the VAT rate cuts this year are slowing the rise in prices. In our projection the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the fourth quarter of. Industrial production and the volume of retail sales continued to grow in January. Labour demand remained strong. The unemployment rate fell further. Strong credit growth continued in January. Outstanding lending to the corporate sector increased by more than percent relative to a year earlier. In the household sector annual growth in lending was close to percent. A significant part of this was related to the expansion in housing loans. Looking ahead the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. From a historically high level of percent in Hungarys current account surplus relative to GDP is expected to fall to below percent in driven by rising domestic demand. However it is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding.

The Banks and the Governments measures contribute substantially to this years economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Risk indicators rose overall. Expectations related to future monetary policy of the worlds leading central banks were the main factors influencing investors appetite for risk. The Fed decided to raise interest rates in March in line with expectations. The ECB is likely to maintain loose monetary conditions. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continue to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market prices suggest that monetary policy stances by regional central banks will continue to differ. The short end of the market yield curve has shifted upwards in recent months while the Banks guidance about the maintenance of loose monetary conditions over an extended period remained unchanged. Hungarian longterm yield spreads rose in parallel with the increase in yields in international financial markets in early. Over a longer horizon however spreads relative to the euro area and the region decreased significantly. In the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions for an extended period is necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end the Monetary Council maintained the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. per cent and the overnight deposit rate at. per cent. In the first quarter the average amount of liquidity crowded out exceeded the HUF billion target set by the Monetary Council in December. In the Councils assessment crowding out a higher amount of liquidity than the target level was necessary to maintain the loose monetary conditions. The Council will keep the HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits. In addition the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the second quarter of at least at HUF billion. Furthermore the Council stated that the actual amount of liquidity to be crowded out must reach a level sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions for an extended period. On the next occasion in June the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The Monetary Council set the maximum stock of monetary policy interest rate swaps in the first half of at HUF billion. The Councils aim is that the loose monetary conditions have their effect not only at the short but also at the longer end of the yield curve. To ensure this the Bank will continue mortgage bond purchases and the monetary policy interest rate swap facility as programmes continuously and for a prolonged period and therefore they constitute an integral part of the set of monetary policy instruments. In harmony with the Councils forward guidance the new instruments contribute efficiently to the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period and to an improvement in financial stability.

Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in then if the assumptions of the current projection hold it will slow down gradually from. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of. In March inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Inflation and core inflation were in line with the Banks expectations. The Banks measures of underlying inflation remained unchanged and continued to be below core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage had led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages which continued into early. The upward effects of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers social contributions at the beginning of the year and in the corporate tax rate in. In the first quarter of services prices rose somewhat faster than last year though still at a moderate pace. Consequently in line with the Banks expectations there has not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. Oil prices increased over the past month. According to the ECBs projections underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the March projection hold the consumer price index will remain in the lower half of the tolerance band in the coming months. Over the medium term buoyant domestic demand and the increase in wage costs will point to an increase in domestic core inflation. However moderate external inflation and inflation expectations stabilising at historically low levels as well as subsequent reductions in employers social contributions and the VAT rate cuts this year are slowing the rise in prices. If the assumptions of the current central bank projection hold the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the fourth quarter of. Industrial production and the volume of retail sales continued to grow in February. Labour demand remained strong. The unemployment rate was at its historical low. Strong credit growth continued in February. Outstanding lending to the corporate sector increased by nearly percent relative to a year earlier. In the household sector annual growth in lending was. percent. A significant part of this was related to the expansion in housing loans. Looking ahead the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. From a historically high level of percent in Hungarys current account surplus relative to GDP is expected to fall to below percent in driven by rising domestic demand. However it is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding.

The Banks and the Governments measures contribute substantially to this years economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Developments related to trade policy measures by the US and China were the main factors influencing investors appetite for risk. Market participants expect the Fed to continue raising interest rates. The ECB is likely to maintain loose monetary conditions. Investors perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continue to be positive. Expectations related to interest rate increases moderated in several countries of the region. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market prices suggest that monetary policy stances by regional central banks will continue to differ. The short end of the market yield curve has shifted upwards in recent months while the Banks guidance about the maintenance of loose monetary conditions over an extended period remained unchanged.

The Council considers the Banks mortgage bond purchase programme to be successful. Under the programme the MNB purchased mortgage bonds with a nominal value of some HUF billion up to the middle of April. Transactions in the primary market accounted for more than onethird of total purchases. As a result of the measures spreads of mortgage bonds over yields in the government securities market fell sharply and turned negative on average.

2018-06-19,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from June The Magyar Nemzeti Bank shifted to inflation targeting regime in. Inflation targeting is a monetary policy framework where the central banks primary objective is to achieve price stability which it seeks to reach with a publicly announced inflation target. Since the Magyar Nemzeti Bank has set its mediumterm inflation target consistent with price stability as a percent increase in consumer prices. The conditions for price stability are assumed to hold if economic agents can expect over a longer period with confidence that inflation remains steadily around the target. From the fiscal turnaround achieved in previous years has made it possible to improve the efficiency of inflation targeting. The ± percentage point tolerance band around the target introduced in March allows the Monetary Council to look through any deviation of inflation from the target in the event of temporary cost shocks thereby mitigating the real economic costs of achieving and maintaining price stability. The time horizon considered by the Council is to quarters. In addition to the priority of the price stability objective the flexible inflation targeting strategy provides a framework where the central bank not only focuses on inflation but also takes into account financial stability and real economic considerations in line with its mandate. After inflation fell significantly below the percent target therefore promoting financial stability and stimulating the real economy through underlying developments were fully consistent with the achievement of the inflation target without jeopardising it. The extension of the Banks micro and macroprudential authority the conversion of foreign currency loans into forints the Selffinancing Programme the Funding for Growth Scheme then the MarketBased Lending Scheme contributed successfully to restoring the monetary transmission mechanism impaired during the crisis to strengthening financial stability and to providing a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. During however inflation is likely to be close to the inflation target again and therefore the Banks policy focus shifts back to its primary mandate to the achievement and maintenance of price stability. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the horizon of monetary policy. These may include developments in commodity prices changes in the external inflation environment labour market conditions the position of the real economy the developments in exchange rate and credit market conditions. By taking into account all these factors the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes which in turn determines the monetary policy response. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks single anchor is inflation. In the Councils assessment in parallel with the pickup in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in then if the assumptions of the current projection hold it will slow down gradually from. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid as the temporary inflation boosting effects of oil price changes fade. In May inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Rising fuel prices were the main factor contributing to the increase in inflation. In line with the Banks expectations measures of underlying inflation continued to be around percent and remained below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage had led to a general dynamic rise in wholeeconomy wages which continued in the first quarter of. The upward effects of this on costs are being offset by the gradual reduction in employers social contributions and in the corporate tax rate in. In line with the Banks expectations upward pressures on inflation from wages continue to be moderate. Oil prices rose significantly over the spring and were considerably higher than in the previous year. According to the ECBs projections however underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the June projection hold the consumer price index will temporarily rise slightly above percent in the coming months reflecting the increase in oil prices. With inflation expectations anchored at low levels higher oil prices are unlikely to generate secondround effects. Over the medium term rising consumption leads to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. However moderate external underlying inflation and inflation expectations stabilising at historically low levels as well as multistage reductions in employers social contributions and the VAT rate cuts this year are slowing the rise in prices. The inflation rate is expected to moderate back again as the direct effects of oil price increases fade and the increase in underlying inflation will ensure that inflation meets the percent target in a sustainable structure from the middle of. The Hungarian economy grew strongly by. percent in the first quarter of relative to a year earlier. On the expenditure side consumption and fixed investments were the main factors contributing to growth. In April industrial production increased and construction output rose at a somewhat moderated pace on annual basis following the outstanding data for the previous period. The volume of retail sales grew markedly. The performance of services improved across a wide range of subsectors and made an increasing contribution to economic growth. Labour demand remained strong. The unemployment rate fell to a historically low level. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand. Economic growth continues in a balanced structure. Looking ahead the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments. The buildup of new export capacities and the pickup in services exports are likely to contribute to export growth and consequently to an increase in Hungarys export market share. The countrys current account balance relative to GDP is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding. In the Councils assessment GDP growth will be. percent in higher than last year then if the assumptions of the current projection hold it will slow down gradually from. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks and the Governments measures contribute substantially to this years economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has been highly volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Expectations related to the policy stance of the worlds leading central banks domestic political events in Europe and global trade policy developments influenced investors appetite for risk. The Fed continued its gradual tightening of monetary conditions. The dollar has appreciated significantly and US longterm yields have risen further over recent months. As a consequence appetite for risk in emerging markets deteriorated. This associated with a generalised increase in volatility led to sharp movements in some countries and had an effect on Central and Eastern European markets as well. The ECB decided to end its asset purchase programme in December therefore the exerted direct effects on the long end of the yield curve will be smaller. However policy interest rates remain unchanged at least until the summer of and therefore the monetary policy environment in the euro area may remain loose. The ECBs decision may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Banks monetary policy. Asset price volatility also increased in domestic financial markets in response to turbulence in international markets. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target focusing on their persistence. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes market prices suggest that monetary policy stances by regional central banks will continue to differ. In the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end the Monetary Council maintained the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent. The Council will maintain the HUF billion upper limit on the stock of threemonth deposits. In addition the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the third quarter of at least at HUF billion. Furthermore the Council stated that the actual amount of liquidity to be crowded out must reach a level sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank increased the stock of finetuning FX swaps providing forint liquidity. On the next occasion in September the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. In June the Monetary Council set the maximum stock of monetary policy interest rate swaps in the first three quarters of at HUF billion. The Bank will continue mortgage bond purchases and the monetary policy interest rate swap facility as programmes and therefore they constitute an integral part of the set of monetary policy instruments. The Council considers the Banks mortgage bond purchase programme to be successful. As a result of the measures spreads of mortgage bonds over yields in the government securities market fell sharply and turned negative on average. The decline in financing costs encouraged issuance in the primary market thereby facilitating the increase in fixedrate lending. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy continue to be stable. Accompanied by dynamic growth the countrys external debt has declined significantly and its net lending continues to be persistently strong. Its fiscal position is sustainable the budget deficit is low and the public debttoGDP ratio has been contracting. The foreign currency debt ratio has fallen sharply. The debt cap rules to be introduced in the autumn will facilitate healthy sustainable growth of housing loans. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks single anchor is inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid as the temporary inflation boosting effects of oil price changes fade. In the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is still necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner.

The Council will ensure the maintenance of loose monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by using the current set of monetary policy instruments.,162,2018

The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid as the temporary inflationboosting effects of oil price changes fade. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks single anchor is inflation. Under the flexible inflation targeting regime the Monetary Council takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the five to eightquarter horizon of monetary policy.

By taking into account all these factors the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes which in turn determines the monetary policy response. In June inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Rising fuel prices were the main factor contributing to the increase in inflation. Developments in measures of underlying inflation were in line with the Banks expectations. Inflation rose slightly above percent while core inflation was unchanged relative to the previous month in June. The general dynamic rise in whole economy wages has continued in recent months however inflationary pressures from wages continue to be moderate consistent with the Banks expectations.

In addition the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the third quarter of at least at HUF billion. Furthermore the Council stated that the actual amount of liquidity to be crowded out must reach a level sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions. On the next occasion in September the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. In June the Monetary Council set the maximum stock of monetary policy interest rate swaps in the first three quarters of at HUF billion. The Bank will continue mortgage bond purchases and the monetary policy interest rate swap facility as programmes and therefore they constitute an integral part of the set of monetary policy instruments. Financing costs fell as a result of the mortgage bond purchases which encouraged issuance in the primary market thereby facilitating the increase in fixedrate lending. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy continue to be stable. Accompanied by dynamic growth the countrys external debt has declined significantly and its net lending continues to be persistently strong. Its fiscal position is sustainable the budget deficit is low and the public debttoGDP ratio has been contracting. The foreign currency debt ratio has fallen sharply. The debt cap rules to be introduced in the autumn will facilitate healthy sustainable growth of housing loans. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks single anchor is inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid as the temporary inflation boosting effects of oil price changes fade. In the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is still necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Council will ensure the maintenance of loose monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by using the current set of monetary policy instruments.,164,2018
2018-09-18,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from September The abridged minutes of todays Council meeting will be published at p.m. on October. In the Councils assessment in parallel with the pickup in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in then if the assumptions of the current projection hold it will slow down gradually from. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid. The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation. Under the flexible inflation targeting regime the Monetary Council takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the five to eightquarter horizon of monetary policy. These may include developments in commodity prices changes in the external inflation environment labour market conditions the position of the real economy developments in the exchange rate and credit market conditions. By taking into account all these factors the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes which in turn determines the monetary policy response. Incoming macroeconomic data for the past quarter were in line with the Banks expectations. In August inflation stood at. percent while core inflation decreased to. percent. Volatile fuel and unprocessed food prices were the main factors contributing to the increase in inflation in the summer months. Inflationary pressures from wages continue to be moderate. According to the European Central Banks ECB projections underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the September projection hold the consumer price index will remain above percent in the short term. From September the increase in excise taxes will also contribute to upward pressure on inflation in addition to fuel and unprocessed food prices while core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will remain stable around. percent. With inflation expectations anchored at low levels secondround effects are not expected to arise. According to our projection rising consumption will lead to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. As temporary effects fade the inflation rate is expected to ease back again and the rise in underlying inflation will ensure that inflation meets the percent target in a sustainable structure from mid. The Hungarian economy grew strongly by. percent in the second quarter of relative to a year earlier. Data on economic activity suggest that robust economic growth is likely to continue. Labour demand remains strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to a historically low level. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in July however proportion of longterm fixedrate lending to corporates continues to be low. Looking ahead economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. The general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments. In the Councils assessment GDP growth will be. percent in higher than last year then if the assumptions of the current projection hold it will slow down gradually from. Meanwhile the countrys current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Developments in international trade policies and events related to vulnerable emerging countries influenced investors appetite for risk. Asset price volatility increased in domestic financial markets as a consequence of the volatile international financial market sentiment. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target focusing on their persistence. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose. The ECBs decisions may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Banks monetary policy. The Banks primary objective is to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. For this reason in the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary. The Council however reviewed its monetary policy instruments and is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. In order to maintain the loose monetary conditions the Monetary Council held the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent. The Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the fourth quarter of unchanged at least at HUF billion. On the next occasion in December the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. Consistent with the practice of leading central banks the MNB is also prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. The set of unconventional instruments affecting shortterm yields will be simplified and the Monetary Council will publish the background material to the Banks instrument strategy. In addition the set of unconventional instruments affecting longterm yields will be finetuned. The set of central bank instruments affecting shortterm yields will become more simple and transparent after the Councils decision to phase out the threemonth deposit facility by the end of. The current HUF billion stock of threemonth central bank deposits will decline to zero by the end of December. The interest rate remunerated on required reserves and preferential deposits will remain equal to the central bank base rate. In the future required reserves will be the main policy instrument. Furthermore in its background material to the Banks instrument strategy the Monetary Council will communicate about the future role of the individual unconventional monetary policy instruments. Looking forward the Bank will adjust the monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments swaps providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the finetuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting longterm yields the Council made a decision to phase out the monetary policy IRS tenders and the mortgage bond purchase programme by the end of. The Council set the annual maximum stock of monetary policy IRS for at HUF billion. The mortgage bond programme will be ended in two stages purchases in the primary market will continue until December and purchases in the secondary market until September. In the meantime the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix FGS fix will be introduced. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. This will contribute to developing a healthy structure for SME lending while having a neutral impact on liquidity developments. The Monetary Council will launch the FGS fix with a total amount of HUF billion in early. With the new programme the Councils specific objective is to raise the proportion of longterm fixedrate lending to SMEs to an adequate level. In contrast with previous phases the Bank will sterilise excess liquidity supply arising from lending under the FGS fix by using the preferential deposit facility. The Bank will publish the most important features and introduction aspects of the programme in the form of a background material. The Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy which will start depending on the outlook for inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid. To ensure this in the Councils assessment maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is necessary.,165,2018

By taking into account all these factors the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes which in turn determine the monetary policy response. In September inflation rose to. percent and core inflation to. percent. In addition to a sharp rise in volatile items particularly fuel and unprocessed food prices the increase in excise taxes on tobacco products were the main factors contributing to the pickup in price level. In line with the Banks expectations the measures of underlying inflation were broadly unchanged staying stable at around. percent. Both core inflation excluding indirect tax effects and stickyprice inflation stagnated while demandsensitive inflation rose modestly. As a result the difference between the consumer price index and the measures of underlying inflation widened further. Inflationary pressures from wages continued to be moderate. Oil prices have increased since the previous interest rate decision. According to the European Central Banks ECB projection underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the September projection hold the consumer price index will remain above percent in the short term. Beginning from the autumn months the increase in excise taxes will also contribute to upward pressure on inflation in addition to fuel and unprocessed food prices while core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will remain stable around. percent. With inflation expectations anchored at low levels secondround effects are not expected to arise. Rising consumption in the September projection will lead to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. As temporary effects fade the inflation rate is expected to ease back again and the rise in underlying inflation will ensure that inflation meets the percent target in a sustainable structure from mid.

In the Councils assessment GDP growth will pick up and stand at. percent in then if the assumptions of the current projection hold it will slow down gradually from. Meanwhile the countrys current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. On the whole sentiment in international financial markets has deteriorated in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Expectations related to the monetary policy stance of the worlds major central banks as well as news about international trade policies developments in the supply of crude oil and Italys government budget were the main factors influencing investors appetite for risk. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target focusing on their persistence. Monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose. The ECBs decisions may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Banks monetary policy. Taking into account the countrys longterm national and economic policy strategy objectives the Magyar Nemzeti Banks Monetary Council increased Hungarys official gold reserves significantly in line with its previous decision. Accordingly the amount of gold reserves expanded from the earlier. tons to. tons in October. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank purchased gold for the first time since. Following the significant increase in the physical form of the stock of gold reserves it has already been transported to Hungary. The Banks primary objective is to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. For this reason in the Councils assessment maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary. Consistent with the practice of leading central banks the MNB is also prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. As part of the instrument strategy presented in September the Monetary Council will phase out the threemonth deposit facility by the end of. In the future required reserves will be the main policy instrument. Looking forward the Bank will adjust monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments the stock of swap instruments providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the finetuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting longterm yields mortgage bond purchases in the secondary market ended consistent with the Councils September decision. In addition the mortgage bond purchase programme in the primary market will be completed and the monetary policy IRS instrument will be phased out by the end of. Furthermore the Monetary Council will launch the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix at the beginning of. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme using a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. In order to maintain the loose monetary conditions the Monetary Council held the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent. In addition in September the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the fourth quarter of unchanged at least at HUF billion.

2018-11-20,At its meeting on November the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from November In the Councils assessment in parallel with the pickup in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level.

In October inflation rose to. percent and core inflation to. percent. Primarily the sharp rise in volatile items particularly fuel and unprocessed food prices moreover the fasterthanexpected passthrough of the increase in excise taxes on tobacco products were the main factors contributing to the pickup in inflation during the autumn months. In October the measures of underlying inflation rose mainly reflecting an increase in tradables prices. Difference between the consumer price index and the measures of underlying inflation remained significant. Inflationary pressures from wages continued to be moderate. Oil prices have fallen since the previous interest rate decision. According to the European Central Banks ECB projection underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. Inflation is expected to decrease but remain slightly above percent in the final two months of the year. Difference between the inflation rate and the measures of underlying inflation will narrow towards the end of the year. Inflation is expected to decrease in the coming months due to the fall in fuel prices while the measures of underlying inflation are likely to rise. Inflation expectations remain anchored at low levels. Rising consumption according to the September projection leads to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. This will ensure that inflation meets the percent target in a sustainable structure from mid. According to preliminary data the Hungarian economy grew strongly by. percent in the third quarter of relative to a year earlier. Labour demand remains strong.

2018-12-18,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from December The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to ensure that the consumer price index meets the percent target in a sustainable manner. The volatility of inflation has increased significantly. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects has been rising which signals the strengthening of persistent inflationary trends. The Hungarian economy has grown dynamically in however if the assumptions of the current projection hold economic growth is likely to slow gradually from. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness will be given increasing emphasis. During the autumn months of volatile items sensitive to movements in global commodity prices led to a greaterthanusual volatility of inflation. As a result the consumer price index rose to. percent in October then decreased significantly to. percent in November. The moderation in inflation was mainly due to a fall in fuel prices in November. However underlying inflation capturing persistent trends continued to rise. In November core inflation excluding indirect tax effects increased to. percent. Over the short term the volatility of inflation remains elevated. After a temporary rise in the first quarter of the consumer price index is expected to fall below percent. In assessing the sustainable achievement of the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent inflationary trends. In parallel with strong domestic demand core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to rise above percent in early and then stays close to percent over the monetary policy horizon. Over the period ahead incoming data will be key in the assessment of persistent inflationary trends. According to the detailed data release the Hungarian economy grew dynamically by. percent in the third quarter of relative to a year earlier. Household consumption and investment continued to increase. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The countrys balance of goods decreased mainly reflecting robust domestic investment growth and a couple of oneoff items. The surplus of the services balance grew significantly. The current account remained in remarkable surplus. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in October however the proportion of longterm fixedrate lending to the corporate sector continued to be low. Economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. Strong domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments in the coming years. The Hungarian economy has grown dynamically in however if the assumptions of the current projection hold economic growth will slow gradually from. The countrys current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as temporary factors fade and as the surplus of the services balance grows dynamically. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy are strong and convergence to developed economies has continued. Regarding longterm sustainable growth the improvement in competitiveness will be given increasing emphasis. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. The main factors influencing investors appetite for risk were expectations about the monetary policy of the worlds leading central banks and uncertainties related to international trade policies the debate of Italys government budget and the Brexit agreement. Amid increased volatility oil prices have fallen since the Councils previous interest rate decision. The current international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Monetary Council assesses these developments in light of their relevance to persistent inflationary trends. As regards the external environment euroarea economic growth fell behind expectations in the third quarter of. The persistence of these developments is uncertain. Headline inflation has been around the percent target while core inflation staying close to percent persistently signals moderate underlying inflation. Therefore market expectations about the timing of the first interest rate increase by the European Central Bank ECB have shifted to a later date. This suggests that monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose for a longer period of time. In terms of the outlook for domestic inflation the probability of core inflation excluding indirect tax effects capturing persistent trends rising above percent has increased. However loose monetary conditions in the euro area may remain for a longer period of time. The main factor among these determining the MNBs monetary policy decisions is developments in persistent domestic inflationary trends. The Monetary Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy which will begin with the modification of unconventional instruments. Consistent with the instrument strategy adopted by the Council looking ahead the Bank will adjust monetary conditions by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments the stock of swap instruments providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the finetuning of unconventional policy instruments affecting longterm yields mortgage bond purchases will end and the monetary policy IRS instrument will be phased out by the end of. In addition the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix will be launched with a total amount of HUF billion in January to raise the proportion of longterm fixedrate lending. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Monetary Council left monetary conditions unchanged. In line with this the Council held the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent. In addition the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the first quarter of unchanged at least at HUF billion. On the next occasion in March the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The Monetary Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy which will begin depending on the persistent inflationary developments. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to continue to rise in the coming quarters which the Council will assess in terms of the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. In the period ahead therefore incoming data will be of key relevance. The Monetary Council closely monitors incoming macroeconomic data and will decide to adjust monetary conditions depending on their outcome.

2019-01-29,At its meeting on January the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from January The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to ensure that the consumer price index meets the percent target in a sustainable manner. The volatility of inflation has increased significantly in recent quarters. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. The recent increase in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects signals a strengthening of persistent inflationary trends. The Hungarian economy grew dynamically in however if the assumptions of the current projection hold economic growth is likely to slow gradually from. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness through structural changes will be given increasing emphasis. Volatile items sensitive to movements in global commodity prices have led to a greaterthanusual volatility of inflation. As a result the consumer price index fell to. percent in December. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects capturing persistent trends continued to increase reaching. percent in December. Over the short term the volatility of inflation remains elevated. After a temporary rise in the first quarter of the consumer price index is expected to fall below percent. In assessing the sustainable achievement of the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent inflationary trends.

Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. The main factors influencing investors appetite for risk were uncertainties related to international trade policies the debate over Italys government budget and the Brexit agreement. In addition to the above factors the government shutdowns in the US and weakerthanexpected Chinese macroeconomic data have led to a recent deterioration in the outlook for world economic growth. Due to the weakening outlook for global and particularly euro area activity leading central banks have taken a more cautious approach. Market expectations about the timing of interest rate increases by the worlds leading central banks have shifted to an ever later date therefore loose monetary conditions may remain for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Amid increased volatility oil prices have risen overall since the Councils previous interest rate decision. The current international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach as the sustained deterioration in the global activity may pose a downside risk to the external inflationary environment. The Monetary Council assesses these developments in light of their relevance to persistent domestic inflationary trends. In terms of the outlook for domestic inflation the probability of core inflation excluding indirect tax effects capturing persistent trends rising above percent has increased while loose monetary conditions in the euro area may remain for a longer period of time.

2019-02-26,At its meeting on February the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from February The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to ensure that the consumer price index meets the percent target in a sustainable manner. The volatility of inflation has increased significantly in recent quarters. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. The recent increase in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects signals a strengthening of persistent inflationary trends. The Hungarian economy grew dynamically in however if the assumptions of the current projection hold economic growth is likely to slow gradually from. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. In January the consumer price index was unchanged at. percent. In the case of the consumer price index the increase in core inflation was offset by a fall in fuel prices. Core inflation rose to. percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects increased to. percent. Core inflation rose mainly due to the stronger price dynamics of market services in addition to an increase in excise taxes on tobacco products. Over the short term the volatility of inflation remains elevated. After a temporary rise in the first quarter of the consumer price index is expected to fall below percent. In assessing the sustainable achievement of the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent inflationary trends. In parallel with strong domestic demand core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to rise above percent in the coming months and then stays close to percent over the monetary policy horizon. Over the period ahead incoming data will be key in the assessment of persistent inflationary trends. Based on the preliminary release Hungarys GDP grew dynamically by. percent in the fourth quarter of relative to a year earlier thus the economy grew by. percent on the whole in. The dynamic expansion in corporate and household lending contributed significantly to last years strong economic growth. Household consumption and investment continued to increase. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate fell to a historically low level in the fourth quarter of. The decline in the balance of goods slowed while surplus of the services balance continued to improve in the fourth quarter. The current account remained in significant surplus in annual terms. The proportion of longterm fixedrate lending to the corporate sector continued to be low. Economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. Strong domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments in the coming years. The Hungarian economy grew dynamically in however if the assumptions of the current projection hold economic growth will slow gradually from. The countrys current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as temporary factors fade and as the surplus of the services balance grows dynamically. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy are strong and convergence to developed economies has continued. Favourable economic developments were reflected in the fact that the international rating agencies SP and Fitch Ratings upgraded Hungarys debt rating from BBB to BBB level. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. In the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision sentiment in international financial markets has been more favourable than earlier. Investors appetite for risk was primarily influenced by developments in international trade policies and uncertainties related to the outlook for growth the Brexit agreement and measures of the worlds leading central banks. Due to the weakening outlook for global and particularly euro area activity the worlds leading central banks have taken a more cautious approach. Based on market expectations about the timing of interest rate increases by the worlds leading central banks loose monetary conditions may remain for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Oil prices have risen since the previous interest rate decision. The international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach as the sustained deterioration in global activity may pose a downside risk to the external inflationary environment. The Monetary Council assesses these developments in light of their relevance to persistent domestic inflationary trends. In terms of the outlook for domestic inflation the probability of core inflation excluding indirect tax effects capturing persistent trends rising above percent has increased while loose monetary conditions in the euro area may remain for a longer period of time.

The Monetary Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy which will begin with the modification of unconventional instruments. Consistent with the instrument strategy adopted by the Council looking ahead the Bank will adjust monetary conditions by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments the stock of swap instruments providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. In addition the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix was launched with a total amount of HUF billion in January to raise the proportion of longterm fixedrate lending. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Monetary Council left monetary conditions unchanged. Accordingly the Council held the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent. In addition in December the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the first quarter of unchanged at least at HUF billion. On the next occasion in March the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The Monetary Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy which will begin depending on persistent inflationary developments. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to continue to rise in the coming quarters which the Council will assess in terms of the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. In the period ahead therefore incoming data will be of key relevance. The Monetary Council closely monitors incoming macroeconomic data and will decide to adjust monetary conditions depending on their outcome.

2019-03-26,At its meeting on March the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from March The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. In February inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. The increase in core inflation mainly reflected higher inflation of processed food and market services to which rises in volatile unprocessed food and fuel prices also contributed in the case of the overall consumer price index. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at. percent in February following a value of. percent in January. Volatile items continue to influence inflation. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Since mid the consumer price index has been continuously fluctuating around percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects rose to percent at the beginning of therefore the MNB has met its inflation target. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining the developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increases. In the coming quarters inflation will fluctuate around the percent central bank target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to continue to rise until the autumn months and then to decline from the end of. In the Hungarian economy grew by. per cent which was largely supported by the strong expansion in corporate and household lending. Household consumption and investment continued to increase. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Developments in the current account balance were influenced by two opposite effects. The balance of goods fell while the services balance rose. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from but to remain strong. As a result of the dynamic growth in credit markets the investment rate is likely to stabilise at high levels. Higher real incomes are expected to contribute to a further expansion in household consumption and savings. However regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. There has been a significant deterioration in the outlook for global growth recently. Recent data from the United States the euro area and China mostly point to a slowdown in economic activity. In addition risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies and by uncertainties related to the Brexit agreement. As a result the worlds leading central banks became more cautious. The Federal Reserve announced the gradual conclusion of its balance sheet reduction. Based on market expectations monetary conditions are likely to remain loose for a longer period than earlier expected. This has been reflected in the declining longterm yields in developed countries since the beginning of. Oil prices have increased somewhat recently. Due to the deteriorating economic outlook in Europe and downside risks to inflation related to the euro area the European Central Bank ECB has modified its forward guidance. Consequently the first interest rate hike has been shifted to a later date. Furthermore the ECB will launch a new series of quarterly targeted longerterm refinancing operations TLTROIII to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and to maintain favourable bank lending conditions. As a result the central bank balance sheet is expected to remain essentially unchanged for a prolonged period. Due to the shift in the first interest rate hike to a later date and balance sheet policy monetary conditions in the euro area will remain loose for a longer period of time. The MNB has met its inflation target. To maintain price stability the Monetary Council deemed it necessary to modify monetary conditions. Accordingly the Council raised the overnight deposit rate by basis points to. percent and left the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate unchanged at. percent. Furthermore the Council reduced the average amount of liquidity to be crowdedout for the second quarter of by HUF billion to at least HUF billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission the Monetary Council will launch its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF billion on July. By introducing a new monetary policy instrument the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme BGS the Councils specific objective is to promote the diversification of the funding to the domestic corporate sector. Under the programme the Bank will purchase bonds having a good rating issued by nonfinancial corporations. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from the bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Bank is publishing the considerations underlying the introduction and the most important features of the programme in the form of a background material and it will publish the document containing details of the conditions until the end of April. The new programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of. By taking these measures the Monetary Council ensures the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative economic agents financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining the developments in inflation. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. The Monetary Council will assess the effects of this on the maintenance of price stability over the quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions the Council applies a cautious approach relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation in the quarterly published Inflation Report.

2019-04-30,At its meeting on April the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from May The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. In March inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects rose from. percent in February to. percent in March. The rise in core inflation partly reflected an increase in excise taxes on tobacco products at the beginning of while the rise in fuel prices also contributed to a pickup in the consumer price index. Regarding developments in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects market services inflation remained broadly unchanged in March and the increase in tradables prices reflected a few individual volatile items. Inflation continues to show large volatility. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining likely developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. In the coming quarters inflation will fluctuate around the percent central bank target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to continue to rise until the autumn months and then to decline from the end of.

Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The countrys current account balance grew in February reflecting a stable services balance and renewed increase in the balance of goods. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from but to remain strong. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets the investment rate is likely to stabilise at high levels. Higher real incomes are expected to contribute to a further expansion in household consumption and savings. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. The outlook for world economic activity and inflation continues to be moderate. Monetary policies across the worlds leading central banks remain cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to the economic activity in Europe and inflation in the euro area in March the European Central Bank ECB shifted its first interest rate hike to a later date. As a result of this and the ECBs balance sheet policy monetary conditions in the euro area will remain loose for a longer period of time than earlier expected.

2019-05-28,At its meeting on May the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from May The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. In April inflation stood at. percent and core inflation at. percent. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects decreased from. percent in March to. percent in April. The increase in services prices was balanced by the decline in highly volatile tradables prices. The rise in fuel prices largely contributed to an increase in the consumer price index in April as well. Volatile items continue to be a dominant component of inflation. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining likely developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. In the coming quarters inflation will fluctuate around the percent central bank target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to continue to rise until the autumn months and then to decline from the end of. Based on the preliminary data release the Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the first quarter of mainly driven by industry construction and market services.

Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the next quarters but to remain strong. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets the investment rate is likely to stabilise at high levels. Higher real incomes are expected to contribute to a further expansion in household consumption and savings. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. The outlook for world economic activity and inflation continues to be moderate. Monetary policies across the worlds leading central banks remain cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to the economic activity in Europe and inflation in the euro area market expectations related to the European Central Banks ECB first interest rate hike shifted to an even later date. As a result monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision.

2019-06-25,At its meeting on June the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from June The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. The factors determining inflation continue to show volatility. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In May inflation was. percent while core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at. percent and. percent respectively. The rise in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects reflected an increase in the rate of market services and processed food prices. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting and from the second half of the year weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Consistent with this core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to rise slightly in the coming months and then due to external disinflationary effects to decline gradually to percent from the end of. The increase of excise duty on tobacco products on a sixmonthly basis which is outside the scope of monetary policy is likely to raise the consumer price index over the entire forecast horizon. This measure does not cause any secondround effects consequently does not influence changes in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the first quarter of mainly driven by market services industry and construction. On the expenditure side in addition to household consumption and investment net exports also contributed positively to economic growth. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Based on monthly preliminary data the current account remained in surplus in the first quarter of. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the middle of the year but to remain strong. Subdued economic activity in Europe from the second half of the year is also reflected in the slowdown of growth in Hungary. The Hungarian economy is expected to grow by. percent in and by. percent in. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets the investment rate is likely to continue to rise and stabilise at high levels in the coming years. Regarding longterm sustainable economic growth the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. In addition to monetary policy the new retail government security strategy the draft budget and the provisions of the Economy Protection Action Plan to improve competitiveness are aimed at further strengthening macroeconomic stability and sustainable convergence. The Hungarian Government Security Plus introduced in June is expected to raise households savings rate in addition to the structural change of their financial assets. Consequently an increasing share of rapid wage growth is converted into savings instead of consumption while the promotion of selffinancing also helps to reduce Hungarys external vulnerability. Based on the draft legislation for next year the budget deficittoGDP ratio with a significant amount of reserves is likely to decline to percent. After fiscal policy will remain countercyclical in as well. Announced in recent weeks the Economy Protection Action Plan is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. The above measures jointly strengthen macroeconomic stability reduce external vulnerability and contribute to maintain a sustainable convergence path. GDP data for the first quarter of exceeded expectations in many cases however the outlook for global economic activity has continued to deteriorate in recent months. Monetary policies across the worlds leading central banks are increasingly cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to economic activity in Europe and the euro area after March the European Central Bank ECB modified its forward guidance again in June. According to communications from the ECB the first interest rate hike shifted to an even later date interest rates remain at their present levels at least through the first half of and beyond. Based on the Presidents latest indications a growing number of market agents are pricing in the loosening of monetary conditions. In the case of the Federal Reserve market agents clearly expect an interest rate cut this year while the Bank of Japan is likely to maintain its loose monetary policy for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies incoming macroeconomic data and measures taken by the worlds leading central banks. Oil prices decreased significantly in the last month. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission the Monetary Council will launch its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF billion on July. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme BGS the Councils specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. Companies have shown considerable interest in bond issuance since the programme was announced at the end of March. As a result of the BGS complementing the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of funding conditions and liquidity of the corporate bond market are expected to improve significantly offering an effective alternative to funding from banks. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Monetary Council left the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent unchanged. In addition in June the Council reduced the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the third quarter by HUF billion from the former HUF billion band to at least HUF billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB is ready to change the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative economic agents financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting and from the second half of the year weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Regarding the outlook for inflation data to be received in the second half of the year will be decisive. Of these the following are of key importance the spillover of disinflationary effects of slowing European economic activity changes in monetary policies of the worlds leading central banks the effect of the new retail government security on savings and the economic consequences of countercyclical fiscal policy. The Monetary Council will assess their effects on the maintenance of price stability over the quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions the Council applies a cautious approach relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation of the quarterly published Inflation Report.

The factors determining inflation continue to show volatility. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Consistent with the MNBs expectations the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices started to slow down in the summer months. In June inflation core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects fell to. percent. percent and. percent respectively. Incoming data confirm the baseline projection in the June Inflation Report. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting and from the second half of the year weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Due to a strengthening of external disinflationary effects core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to decline gradually to percent from the end of. The increase of excise duty on tobacco products on a sixmonthly basis which is outside the scope of monetary policy is likely to raise the consumer price index over the entire forecast horizon. This measure does not cause any secondround effects consequently does not influence changes in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the first quarter of mainly driven by market services industry and construction. Based on monthly indicators growth rate in retail sales and construction slowed in the second quarter. In line with our expectations incoming data suggest that the dynamics of GDP growth is likely to slow down gradually from the second quarter. Compared to the previous high levels wage growth continued at a slightly weaker rate in April. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The current account remained in surplus in the first quarter of. Due mainly to dynamic growth in imports the trade surplus declined in recent quarters primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the middle of the year but to remain strong. Subdued economic activity in Europe from the second half of the year is also reflected in the slowdown of growth in Hungary. The Hungarian economy is expected to grow by. percent in and by. percent in. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets the investment rate is likely to continue to rise and stabilise at high levels in the coming years.

Consequently an increasing share of rapid wage growth is converted into savings instead of consumption while the promotion of selffinancing also helps to reduce Hungarys external vulnerability. Following its launch on June the outstanding amount of Hungarian Government Security Plus rose by over HUF billion. More than half of this amount was registered as a new source of finance for the government sector. Based on the Budget Act the budget deficittoGDP ratio is likely to decline to percent with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After fiscal policy will remain countercyclical in as well. The announced Economy Protection Action Plan is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. The above measures jointly strengthen macroeconomic stability reduce external vulnerability and contribute to maintain a sustainable convergence path. Due to uncertainties related to the outlook for global economic activity monetary policies across the worlds leading central banks continue to be increasingly cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to economic activity in Europe and the euro area and communications from the European Central Bank ECB market participants are pricing in the loosening of monetary conditions over the short term. According to market expectations the Federal Reserve may reduce the policy rate in more than one step in while the Bank of Japan is likely to maintain its loose monetary policy for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has slightly improved since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies incoming macroeconomic data and measures taken by the worlds leading central banks.

The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling nearly HUF billion in the first half of. The Monetary Council left the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent unchanged.

2019-08-27,At its meeting on August the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from August The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. The factors determining inflation continue to show volatility. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Consistent with the MNBs expectations the annual consumer price index started to decline in the summer months. In July inflation core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects fell to. percent. percent and. percent respectively. Both industrial goods and services inflation slowed compared to the previous month. Persistent inflation developments were overall lower even than expected. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting and weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. Due to a strengthening of external disinflationary effects core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to decline gradually to percent from the end of. The increase of excise duty on tobacco products on a sixmonthly basis which is outside the scope of monetary policy is likely to raise the consumer price index over the entire forecast horizon. This measure does not cause any secondround effects consequently does not influence changes in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Lowerthanexpected underlying inflation data for recent months and the ongoing deterioration in external activity indicate strengthening in downside risks to the longerterm inflation outlook. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the second quarter of mainly driven by market services industry and construction. On the expenditure side domestic demand might have continued to grow. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The current account remained in surplus in the first quarter of. Due mainly to dynamic growth in imports the trade surplus declined in recent quarters primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the middle of the year but to remain strong. Subdued economic activity in Europe from the second half of the year is also reflected in the slowdown of growth in Hungary. The Hungarian economy is expected to grow by. percent in and by. percent in. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets the investment rate is likely to continue to rise and stabilise at high levels in the coming years.

Consequently an increasing share of rapid wage growth is converted into savings instead of consumption while the promotion of selffinancing also helps to reduce Hungarys external vulnerability. Since its launch more than HUF billion of Hungarian Government Security Plus has been purchased. More than half of the purchases was registered as a new source of financing for the government sector. Based on the Budget Act the budget deficittoGDP ratio is likely to decline to percent with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After fiscal policy will remain countercyclical in as well. The announced Economy Protection Action Plan is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. The above measures jointly strengthen macroeconomic stability reduce external vulnerability and contribute to maintain a sustainable convergence path. Due to the deteriorating outlook for global economic growth monetary policy stances of the worlds leading central banks have become increasingly looser recently. Consistent with unfavourable European activity data and continued moderate inflation developments the possibility of an interest rate cut appeared in the European Central Banks July forward guidance. In line with this market participants expect an easing of monetary policy already in September. In July the Federal Reserve reduced the policy rate for the first time since. Meanwhile market participants expect further loosening measures over the remainder of the year. In its forward guidance the Bank of Japan signalled that if necessary it was ready to ease policy further. Sentiment in international financial markets has deteriorated since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies measures taken by the worlds leading central banks and expectations of their future policy measures domestic political tensions in Italy and news relating to Brexit. Oil prices have fallen recently. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission the Monetary Council launched its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF billion on July. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme BGS the Councils specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. Corporate bond issuances are expected to pick up in the fourth quarter. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme participating credit institutions have concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling HUF billion until end of July. The Monetary Council left the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent unchanged. In addition in June the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the third quarter at least at HUF billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. Accordingly the stock of FX swaps providing forint liquidity has increased recently in order to achieve the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out. In its decisions the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative economic agents financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting and weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. Regarding the persistent inflation trends downside risks have strengthened. In assessing their extent data to be received in the second half of the year will be decisive. Of these the following are of key importance the spillover of disinflationary effects of slowing European economic activity changes in monetary policies of the worlds leading central banks the effect of the new retail government security on savings and the economic consequences of countercyclical fiscal policy. The Monetary Council will assess their effects on the maintenance of price stability over the quarter horizon of monetary policy.

2019-09-24,At its meeting on September the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from September The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. Inflation continues to be volatile. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In August inflation core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at. percent. percent and. percent respectively. In the summer months the consumer price index was in line with the MNBs expectations. However underlying inflation developments were significantly lower than expected. This was mainly attributable to the slowing price dynamics of industrial goods. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. The significantly lowerthanexpected core inflation excluding indirect tax effects and the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity indicate a strengthening in downside risks to the longerterm outlook for inflation. Due to the base effects of the fall in fuel prices last year the consumer price index is likely to rise again until the end of and then to stabilise at the level of the percent inflation target following a gradual decline. In the coming months core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to rise slightly before decreasing to percent along a lower than previously expected path due to external disinflationary effects. The Hungarian economy grew by. percent in the second quarter of primarily driven by investment and consumption on the expenditure side as well as market services industry and construction on the production side. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Due to dynamic import growth the trade surplus declined in recent quarters primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow in the coming quarters. Weakening economic activity in Europe is likely to have an increasingly strong effect on the development of Hungarian GDP as well. Consistent with the gradual deceleration in economic growth the increase in wages is likely to slow. In parallel the growth rate of consumption is also likely to slow down. Hungarys export growth may be more muted reflecting the deterioration in the global and European demand outlook. Hungarys GDP is expected to grow by. percent in and by. percent in and respectively. Despite weakening external activity the convergence of the Hungarian economy with the euro area is likely to continue in the coming years with the maintenance of the at least percentagepoints growth rate surpluses. In addition to monetary policy several government measures jointly strengthen Hungarys macroeconomic stability and reduce external vulnerability. Since its launch in June nearly HUF billion of Hungarian Government Security Plus has already been purchased. More than half of the purchases was registered as a new source of financing for the government sector. Based on the ratified Budget Act the budget deficittoGDP ratio is likely to decline to percent with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After fiscal policy will remain countercyclical in and in line with the Convergence Programme in as well. The Economy Protection Action Plan announced in May is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. As result of the deterioration of the global economic outlook and the muted inflationary processes the external monetary policy environment has become looser again. After July the Federal Reserve reduced its policy rate in September as well. At its latest policy meeting the European Central Bank ECB decided to lower the deposit rate by basis points and restart its asset purchase programme in an openended manner. According to the ECBs communication policy rates are likely to remain at their present or lower levels until inflation rises close to the central bank target in a sustainable manner. According to global leading central banks indications and analysts expectations a looser monetary policy environment will be persistently maintained and additional loosening measures can be expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile since the Councils previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies and the Brexit and measures taken by the global leading central banks. Oil prices have risen in the period since the Councils previous interest rate decision and geopolitical risks point to higher volatility in the oil market. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission the Monetary Council launched its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF billion on July. Under the programme the MNB purchased corporate bonds in September for the first time possibly to be followed by further purchases in the near future. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling nearly HUF billion until the end of August. The Monetary Council left the base rate the overnight collateralised lending rate and the oneweek collateralised lending rate at. percent and the overnight deposit rate at. percent unchanged. In addition in September the Council raised the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the fourth quarter by HUF billion from the previous HUF billion band to at least HUF billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative economic agents financing costs will be favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. In the Monetary Councils assessment previously symmetric risks to inflation became asymmetric in the last quarter. The downside inflation risks have strengthened further reflecting the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity. Due to the measures taken by global leading central banks the external monetary policy environment has become looser. The Council will assess the effects of these factors on the maintenance of price stability over the quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions the Monetary Council applies a cautious approach relying mainly on the incoming data and the projections in the quarterly published Inflation Report. Future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures.

2019-12-17,At its meeting on December the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from December The Magyar Nemzeti Banks MNB single anchor is inflation its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. Inflation continues to be volatile. Therefore in assessing the outlook the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In November inflation core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at. percent. percent and. percent respectively. The increase in inflation mainly reflected the base effect in fuel prices and a rise in food prices. A dichotomy still remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting while persistently muted external activity is restraining the pace of inflation. In the past quarter fears of recession subsided in the euro area. As a result risks to the outlook for domestic inflation became balanced again. The consumer price index is expected to rise further temporarily until January mainly reflecting the base effect of fuel prices and the increase in food prices. Following a gradual decline inflation is likely to stabilise at the percent inflation target in the second half of the forecast horizon. Inflation expectations remain anchored.

Due to the great interest central bank purchases are likely to exceed twothirds of the total amount available under the Scheme until the end of with the remaining part likely to be used early next year. Taking into account the high utilization of the Scheme the Monetary Council will raise the original total amount of HUF billion to HUF billion from January with all other conditions left unchanged. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling more than HUF billion until the end of November. In its decisions the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative economic agents financing costs will be favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting while persistently muted external activity is restraining the pace of inflation. Following a temporary rise the consumer price index is likely to decline gradually and is expected to return to close to the percent inflation target in the second half of the forecast horizon. In the Monetary Councils assessment risks to inflation has become symmetric again. In the coming years Hungarys GDP growth is likely to be slightly higher than earlier projected while the outlook for growth in the euro area is likely to be persistently muted. Consistent with this the external monetary policy environment is expected to remain persistently loose however forward guidance of the worlds leading central banks does not indicate further loosening measures. The Monetary Council will assess the effects of these factors on the maintenance of price stability over the quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions the Monetary Council applies a cautious approach relying mainly on the incoming data and the projections in the quarterly published Inflation Report.
